[Talib Kweli]
Yo you sent out the signal right?
And this is what happened
The voice of Hip Hop got heard
Never comprimised this is how we put it down c'mon

[Kool G Rap]
Throughout my thuglife I've seen the ???
Like ??? fight over the role of dice
Flashing whole lights when killas on a hiest
So contight, get poltergiest over the bowl of Christ
Who pulled the slice from cats aiming gats who showed the hiest
Told you right she be the one that come and hold your mic
Then aim it at the whole vice squad just like ???
Rollin like every prototype was dolomight
One man recall his ice inside his gun hand he holds for life

[Rah Digga]
This for the ones with holes in they graves
Waitin for they piece when the law misbehave
I say we off ??? watch 'em walk the beat
Like you can't cross streets make them all retreat
(now) Judges and the jury be a little to appointed
Making us defendants when we supossed to be the plantiffs
Laugh now cause soon the thrill stops
Heads get it on and start to kill cops

[Sporty Theivz]
I'm sober but the pull me over
What i do yo? (what we do yo?)
Poe-poe go i'm drivin to slow (cool yo)
I torin' them explorin them (damn)
For them that's why i'm ignoring them (uh-oh)
Bring like king skip
Before they bring this to some Rodeny King shit
Forget them fools
Now make no sudden moves
They reachin for they tools (let's move)
You buggin dude
Kirk you ran the stop, word them pigs frontin
Yo tell like you tell 'em cousin we ain't did nothin
All they see is three blacks in a jeep with seats back
Lookin for ??? packs how the blood dog can eat that
They thirstin for a reason to blast you can't beat that
Gats and a badge to match you can beat that so bounce 'em

[Mos Def]
My people unite and let's all get down
We gotta have what? love peace and understandin
One god, One love, One light
One aim, One voice, One fight
My people unite, hop up and do it right
We gotta have what? love peace and understandin
One god, One love, One light
One aim, One voice, One fight
My people unite, hop up and do it right
Do it right ya'll, keep it tight ya'll, do it right ya'll, just do it

[Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Blood on they hands, blood on my mans
Destroying the fam
More souljers die, another mother cries
Anthony Buyers, ??? ???, Diallo
Let it keep happenin and theirs more to follow
It's even deeper then that penal shot in the back
Forever we fight and cus but the world still adjust
So many bullets just to stop one man
Is that the plan,
To leave us all dead in the street

[Common]
I'm an opponent of violence
To many of my guys have to condome it in silence
Law takes lives and can only do violence
And with night sticks i write quick
Hopin that

[Talib Kweli and Common]
I might hit somebody in the heart

[Talib Kweli]
Like an arrow with her eyes on a sparrow
Yo i feel my peoples pain all in my bone marrow

[Common]
I'm tellin Pharoahe to let my folks go
Ma's been singin to law like they background vocals

[Talib Kweli]
Local, state, federal cops have been payed properly
To protect the property
How can i just stand by and watch a man die for nothin and not react
The way we spit on this track is how we bustin back

[Common]
Yo i pimp slap 5-0
Get behind them and make the marks drive slow

[Talib Kweli]
Yo, you wanna know how to improve on the quality life?
Try respectin it step into my zone and maifest a check in it

[Pharoahe Monch]
Cops they transport me from Long island to Medina 
with they fucked up demeanor
Dreamin of stickin it to me like Abner Louima
Pharoahe slash El-Hajj Malik Shabazz 
with plans of retaliations of they coward ass
God please allow me to preach for 'em
A voiceless man through a spirit i speek for him
Step to city hall if a dove flew for Diallo
with a vision of cops inside the Public Enemy logo

[Posdnous]
All that scheming and plotting
The young absorb like cotton does
Ecspeacially in my city where the boys steady rockin in
You would thought 5-0 would cut it all short
But they play the biggest part in the art of living arms
In our land cops guns clap more then hands
As if we don't deserve what they hear to preserve
We just tryin to do it right in these worlds that we rappin in
While they trying to fill us all up with more lead then zepilin

[Everyone Lead by Mos Def]
