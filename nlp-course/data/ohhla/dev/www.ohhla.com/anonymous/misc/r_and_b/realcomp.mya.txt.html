Artist: Mya f/ Common
Album:  Moodring
Song:   Real Compared To What? (Bonus Track)
Typed by: kfu12@hotmail.com

(Intro/Bridge)
[Mya]
Try to make it real compared to what
Real, real, yeah, lets make it really real
Real real, yeah, lets make it really real, yeah

[Common]
If it's real to you is it real to me
How can one judge what I feel in me?
Makin moves y'all but it's still in me
We all move in search of stability
Sweet dreams, mama it's reality
Times I stand out like a balcony
In a material world full of fallacies
The truest place I found in me
That's wussup!

(Chorus)
[Mya]
Try to make it real compared to what
Compared to this y'all
Ain't nuttin real y'all
Try to make it real compared to what
*harmonizing*

[Mya]
Sock it to me now

[Common]
The real can't be brought or sold, taught or told
The boy tried to keep it but he lost his soul
On the road to the riches he lost control
About the eye of a needle I was often told
If you stand for nothing then you'll fall for gold
Then your actions all is told

[Mya]
And the games you better have all control
But babe it's all a go
You better recognize what's real
Or you might jus lose your soul

[Common]
Thru life's actions, cars, fitteds, cameras snappin
Pop life, is it a demand for passion
Are we really real or are we actin
Right thru the face, smiles and maskin
Rationalize the real recognize
Real, it's all in the eyes
Some times I feel it's all a disguise
The truth is revealed then I realize
That's wussup!

(Bridge)

[Mya  & Common]
[M]	Try to make it real compared to what
[C]	Keep doin it, I'm feelin it
[C] 	Keep doin it, I'm feelin it
[M]	You know the...
[M]	Preacher's doin evil tryin to teach us right from wrong
[C]	False prophets diggin in our pockets
[C]	Situation tight don't fall for the hype
[M]	And everywhere you turn
[M]	They're criticizing what's goin on
[C]	In this time and place, tryin to find a place
[C]	I can get free and just be me
[M]	IAlways judgin by the cover
[M]	There's got to be a reason
[C]	Open ya mind, seek and define
[C]	The realness in all mankind
[M]	And ever since the wind blowed upon their voices
[M]	What have we done?
[C]	We losin, abusing life
[C]	Tryin hard to be real when real is right
[M]	Everybody (c'mon) got to make it real
	Everybody you got to know the deal (know the deal)
	Everybody got to make it real
	Everybody you got to know the deal

[Common]
They say money make a man strange
Is it money or he don't understand change
Money to be real, we campaign
If it's you, then just do ya thang, thang
Maintain who we are as the game change
Everybody wanna star in the same game
I ain't travel this far to do the same thang
It's a trip how the real now is mainstream
That's wussup!

(Chorus)

(Bridge)

[Mya]
Try to make it real compared to what
Gotta make it real so you know it's real
Try to make it real (let's do it)...sock it to me know!

[Common (Mya)]
To my people keep rockin on
To my people keep rockin on (rockin on)
To my people keep rockin on
To my people keep rockin on
To my people keep rockin on
To my people keep rockin on (my people keep rockin on)
To my people keep rockin on
To my people keep rockin on (keep rockin on)
Rockin on keep rockin on (reeal....)
Rockin on keep rockin on</pre>
