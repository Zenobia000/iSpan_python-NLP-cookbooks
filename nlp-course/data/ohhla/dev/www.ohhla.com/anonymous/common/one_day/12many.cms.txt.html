One wa-wa One, One Two, One Two
One wa-wa One, One Two, One Two
One tigga One, One Two, One Two

(Dug Infinite)
Dug Inf on production, my man Com for the discussion
Check it

(Common)
One day, I was tryin to be myself
The same day this thug say, "You gotta come hard"
Nigga, times is hard, I'm tryin hard to make it
It ain't hard to tell, it's hard for me to fake it
Plus, it's hard to be me, it's hard to stop drinkin
I guess it's hard for you hard niggaz to start thinkin
Pussy MC's stinkin so I can't get hard
Some, become MC's cause it's hard to get a job
Hard for you to trust people, you don't trust in God
Even harder to be the Gods we created to be
This Western way of life ain't native to me
Put one nigga in your Pulp Fiction that related to me
I hate it that we, the only race that call our women hoes
Niggaz, be too hard to say "ho" at the shows
I rose... like a florist to bring the flavor like a Taurus
Might not have the murderous verse, but I stay hard to the chorus
Took this girl to work, she say I ain't have a real job
Like that dick you had last night, baby, I work real hard
Simple motherfuckers tellin me hard is criminal
Niggaz you thought was hard, you pourin out your liquor for
Years ago, I thought I was hard, in high school fightin
Now, I'm the hardest man working in show business
Handle your business or shut the fuck up

(Dug Infinite)	It's just one two many niggaz got cars and no land
(Common)	One two many niggaz with cash and no plan
(Dug Infinite)	One two many niggaz that's tryin to MC
(Common)	That's one two many niggaz comin up to me
(both)		That's one two many niggaz
		Just one two many niggaz (2X)
(both)		That's one two many niggaz
		Just one two many niggaz
(Chuck D)	"One, two"

Forever, I ain't gon' be rappin
Shit'll happen to me, I gotta let niggaz know
This mark asked me do I know his cousin Jimbo
Nigga, I don't even know myself
You want me to get you in
Jack, I'm trying to get through the do' myself
Opportunity knocked, but he ain't call 'fore he came
Yeah, I got a name, but only twenty dollars to it
Next album you gon' blow, up my ass, you done blew it before
Being in my video, what's that gonna do for your life?
Get you some pussy?  You should be gettin rump off GP
Quit that you look like you say I seen you on TV
I be readin niggaz but readin be makin me sleepy (Hey!)
So strong am I, A Hundred Styles and Runnin
Niggaz stuck on one and them-a ran by
Claimin they fly but they stand-by
I come truer than a dream, and youse a damn lie
With that anti-rap, complainin about this and about that
Sounding bitch like, that ain't gonna make a nigga get right
I'm number one

(Dug Infinite)	One two many niggaz tryin to tell me bout they theory
(Common)	One two many niggaz that ain't tryin to hear me
(Dug Infinite)	One two many niggaz doin shows that don't happen
(Common)	One two many niggaz life depend on rappin
(both)		That's one two many niggaz
		Just one two many niggaz (2X)
(both)		That's one two many niggaz
		Just one two many niggaz
(Chuck D)	"One, two"

(Dug Infinite)	One two many niggaz can't find they niche
(Common)	One two many niggaz wanna be my bitch *echoed*

Nigga, one two many niggaz (repeat to fade)</pre>
