Artist: Common f/ Q-Tip
Album:  One day It'll All Make Sense
Song:   Stolen Moments Pt. III

Q-Tip:
Hey , hey, hey, hey,
Hey, who dat? Hey, who dat?
Hey, who dat? Check it, what
Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are(x2)
Hey sucka nigga, hey sucka nigga
Whoever you are, whoever you are

Common:
Fuck waitin under my skin, the situation is scrapin
Somewhat like the girl X-ratin
It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation
Knowing your Rockports, somebody may be lacin
Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation
Without somebody breakin in my demonstration
For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net
It certain things about this I ain't figure yet
Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys
Because his job had been stopped smokin weed
Thursdays is off days, he usually watch his seed
For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need
The stripper broad, my TV and couch, she couldn't carry it
Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with
She was vegeterian and she wouldn't have cooked chicken
I confronted her with it, to her story, she was stickin
The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this hype
Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bike
Chances of him breakin in, chillin and eatin 
Are about as slim as he is
Though I knew where he lived
In his house with three kids, one I was cool with
As we roll, I told the guy, turn on the music
Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect
The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck

(Excerpt from a movie)
Just tell me why. Don't lie to me man, just tell me why
It's the money, alright?
Just tell me why
It's the fuckin money, alright?
(fighting)
Reynoldo, shoot that piece of shit

Q-Tip:
Know what I'm sayin. Word up
It ain't sweet when you do that shit(x7)
