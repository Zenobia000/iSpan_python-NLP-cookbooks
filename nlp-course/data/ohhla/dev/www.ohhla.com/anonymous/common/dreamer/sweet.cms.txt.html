("You look so sweet, so.." "You look so sweet..")

[Intro: Common]
Yeah...
Y'know they be askin 'bout Common, where he at?
What that man doingnow?
I'm doin what I do -- hip-hop
That's what I do
Yeah

[Common]
How can I say this? Fuck it, I'm the greatest!
I am the A-list for all these great debaters
A lot of y'all nah-now, forgot now who I am
The '87 nigga used to rah-rah in the jam
Ah YEAH~! We put them things in the air
When I drop a single, it's really like a pair
of Air Jordans, important to the culture
If you ain't true to it, ¡cállate la boca!
Get my drink on like a coaster
Post up on the wall that Mike used to live off
Hip-Hop Master Cleanse and I'ma get my shit off
Rollin in a Maserati Gran with the lid off
I bit all like a monster, live nigga this is my encore
Encore, encore, I rhyme for the Commoners
My name synonymous with prominence
I'm to Hip-Hop what Obama is to politics
Common is...

Yeah! 
Man, y'all niggaz man, you soft mother...
Yeah my man, motherfucker!
Man, come around my crib, you know where I'm from
Some hoe-ass niggaz
Singin all around here man, "La-la-lah," all that
You ain't no motherfuckin Frank Sinatra (Uh..)
Lil' bitch! Yeah, this the raw right here
This the raw right here, nigga!
Sweet motherfucker! Sweet-ass bitch motherfucker!

Wa-da-da, da, wa-dada-dada-dang!
The C-O double-M O-N, I'm not playin!
Da-da man at work, I make my own lane
I'm the franchise so I rock my own chain
Know I said give 'em that 80s' Cocaine
Somethin raw, somethin pure so I stayed in that vein
The hero that he know, that he cold like when it's 
below in the Geo, wipe ya feet off in the Regal
I'm king, observe the throne AND the dream
I have it, +Supreme+ like +Mathematics+
Yeah, a breath of fresh air for you asthmatic rap addicts
Pro-black magic, this is semi-automatic
Rap, it won't jam in traffic
The game need direction, I'm here to map it, uh~!
Uh, some people say that they be missin creativity
But when it come to hip-hop, it begins and ends with me -- SWEET

[Outro: Common]
Y'know... y'know man, you should know where I come from
You should know who I am, nigga!
MAN, you know! You should never wanna go against me
You know man, you too soft for that, man!
I-I be seein you man, I see it in yo' eyes, man!
You ain't the type of nigga that could go against me!
You get in my presence you gon' feel like a lil' hoe!
You ain't a man yet, you tryna be somebody else!
MAN, BE YOURSELF, MAN! 
You come around my crib, you get yo' shit took, HUH~!
Wherever you go, you probably be overseas in Europe and get yo' shit took
Youse a hoe! You know you sweet!
Ain't nothin you can do man, people see that man
Broads be seein you sweet!
Done wit you muh... it's over for you
It's over for you! It's OVER! Sweet motherfucker..</pre>
