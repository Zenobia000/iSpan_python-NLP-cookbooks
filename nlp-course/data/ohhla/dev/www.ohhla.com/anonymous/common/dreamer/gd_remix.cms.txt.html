[Intro]
Dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggaz dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggaz dreams
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggaz dreams
From the hood
{*scratches*} Dreams

[Common]
From the hood, y'all
Yo, I want a bitch that look good and cook good
Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flippin pancakes
Plus she's trickin out the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake, her titties ain't fake
Fuckin in the car cause we just can't wait
to get home, early in the morn' gettin stoned
Pretty with her eyes low, bunny by her Bible
The type of bitch that Big said he would die fo'
is the type that I'd ride and stay alive fo'
Tats on her back, lookin all tribal
She knows shoes, like she knows survival
Well-put together, she weather the storm
Seen her brother die so forever she's strong
Hear Beyoncé's song and she gotta perform
Whether fuckin or fightin, we gettin it on

[Chorus]
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggaz dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggaz dreams
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto ghetto niggaz dreams
From the hood
{*scratches*} Dreams

[Common]
I don't even say shit, she can feel it
I talks the realest, toenails acryllic
Ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it
Baby in one arm, the other is a skillet
Fried chicken, macaroni, raised on the black and stony
Ghetto Prince, she's my Apolloni'
Like trigger had the back of Tony, Montana
Reminded me of me of my, of my momma
Uhh, knowin the drama like she know when to joke
Steal a nigga's squares, not wantin me to smoke
I poke my head out of Benzes
My street sense is streets and I know who my friends is
Endless love for the money, power and clothes
My ghetto housewife watch reality shows
She might get to snappin if the cabinets ain't closed
When the camera starts snappin, she ready to pose, ahh

[Chorus]

[Common]
At the movies, she ain't scared to pull my dick out
Big dreams and move things to a big house
that's roomy, love to see her comin out of bloomies
Face opposite of gloomy, ah what it does to me
Sunday morning at church, she covered like a Sunni
Come back home, singin shine your light like umi
Truly truly she grown, don't check a nigga phone
Even when I roam, I still know where home - is
They type you want raisin ya kids
About takin out the garbage, she stay in ya ear
She know sacrifice, and flashing lights
Street and the fashion life, her you could ask advice
about ANYTHING~! She might get a ring
Got a lot of sibilings, money she can get it clean
Remindin me of a broad that I took to Evergreen
Money plus a good chick - that's a hood dream

[Chorus]

{*"Yeah" scratched to the end*}</pre>
