Artist: Common f/ Makeba Riddick
Album:  The Dreamer/The Believer
Song:   Blue Sky
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro: sample of "Mr. Blue Sky" by Eletric Light Orchestra]
{"Mr. Blue Sky, Mr. Blue S.." <- repeat 4X}
{"Why you had to hide away for..." <- repeat 4x}

[Common]
Aston Martin King, Luther with dreams
A young Denzel the way I move through scenes
I'm like a preacher that once was a fiend
A story of change that came with wings
Pretty as the skyline, the sky is my eyeline
Son of the Most, so from up high, I shine
Suited in Prada, stay +'Mellow+ like LaLa
Young fresh with dollas, ladies go +Gaga+
I'm the cum laude, top of the class
Black Wall Street, so my stock'll never crash
Given what I asked: pure religion and cash
For the windows that open, I'm raising my glass
Daylight beams, nightlife schemes
This is my +Inception+, I'm writin my dreams
Immortal view of a star, doin what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky, say the Lord's coming through

[Chorus: Makeba Riddick]
Oh-oh-oh, in the sky we'll find the light
Oh-oh-oh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night
Now we in the skiiiiies, blue skiiiiies
And we goin hiiigh-higher, that's right

[Common]
It all started with a dream, I wanted to be Run-D.M.C.
The Lord put the blessing upon the emcee/M-C
O to the M, dreams were spoken to him
That's when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim
Open my eyes, yessir~! This is what I'm made for
To go hard in the paint, like D. Wade or
D. Rose from the same streets that we rose
International heroes at world primo's
Red carpet magic, taking pictures with the president
Told him for health care, my music is the medicine
My name holds weight, I am never hesitant
Different state resident, this is hood elegance
SLS classin, pursuing my passion
Known for fashion, now I'm Oscar party crashin
Immortal view of a star, doin what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky, say the Lord's coming through

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Ey, e-eh, eh, eh, hey {repeat 4X}

[Common] (Makeba Riddick)
Silhouettes of dreams that we had, ha!
Even now, it don't seem so bad, ma
Close my eyes to see things in front of me
I'm GONE now, imagine what I'm gonna be!
Dirty to worthy, now I'm all worldly
My broad up in Paris, lookin all purdy
Immortal view of a star, doin what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky, say the Lord's coming through, ah!
 (Now we in the skiiiiies, blue skiiiiies
  And we goin hiiigh-higher, that's right)
So live, get 'em high

[Bridge: Makeba Riddick]
I had these dreams in my head of an endless fear
I could see it from my window
Wouldn't take that long to get me there
Keep running 'til I can go
But all of the beautiful things that life could give me
Crazy how I'm the one
Could've been anywhere, but I'm sitting in the air
With the wheels up staring at the sun

[Chorus]</pre>
