Song:   Cloth

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh-ohh {4X}
 
[Common]
We were from different cities on the same block
Grew up in different circles in the same spot
Like raindrops we fall in love giving our all
Showin her ring off like a player at the ball
I recall, the walls that I had up
Attracted to women for things that didn't matter
"Ka-clow! BOOM! POP!" Sound of my heart when it drop
The night that I met her, it might be forever
I hear people sayin that they like us together
I ain't afraid to gamble when life is gettin better 
with you, I admit I had issues
like Ebony or Essence, your pedigree, your presence
is more than clothes can say for you
When I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you
I pray for you and us, that we imbue through lust
and accrue the trust, let's shake off the dust from the cloth
 
[Chorus: James Fauntleroy II]
Oh you're worried about when people stop and stare
That's just a tear, on those beautiful clothes you wear
Cut from the same, cloth you just want to wear
But that's just a tear, 'cause girl I can get you fresh
La la la lah... La la la lah...
La la la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-lah
La la la lah... La la la lah...
La la la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-lah
 
[Common]
This is tailor-made love, fit like a snug
Anything we can bear so let's have some +cubs+
You were there when my cuz passed away
Not only does love, but life hatches day
I appreciate the hugs and the days, I breed with you
Strong seeds I can see with you, the Good Word I read with you
Lookin at things that we've been through
Things that seem simple, I know when to go hard and when to be gentle
Sentimental laughs and expressions
Let's stay in the present, no time for second guessin
You said it's this cloth that makes you feel naked
The truth we address it, that's so unexpected
Yeah that's the thread that helps us move ahead
Your hunger for affection will always be fed
Thank God we never sped and let love take its course
Because what's inside of us, no need to outsource, the cloth
 
[Chorus]
 
[Common]
Hey lover, we can cover each other
through the coldest nights, tight never smother (We'll be cool)
It's two things, that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever                   (Seeing through)
It's two things, that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's two things, that seems to hold us together (Beautiful)
God is our tailor and forever
It's the cloth
 
[Chorus] </pre>
