Artist: Common f/ John Legend
Album:  The Dreamer/The Believer
Song:   The Believer
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Chorus: John Legend]
I believe in the light that shines and will never die
Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive
Theeeey will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
Theeeey will talk about us

[Common] (Legend)
These are the words of a believer achiever, leader of the globe
Feed the souls of those in need, I bleed 
the blood of the struggle, walkin over troubled puddles
Hustles in my chest, no hustle no progress
Extremities of life and its process
Birth of a son, death of another
With love I caress both mothers and told 'em,
"Who's in control is the one that's above us"
I walk where money talks and love stutters
Body language of a nation goin through changes
The young become dangerous, pain gets spent into anger (I know, I know, I know)
Anger gets sent through the chamber
It's tough when your own look like strangers
We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers
If he could, how would Ernie Barnes paint us?
Look at the picture, hard not to blame us (Theeeey will talk about us)
But time forgives in the Chi where the young die often
Do they end up in a coffin because we haven't taught them?
Is it what we talkin we really ain't walkin?
Dues hustlers pay, how much did it cost 'em? (Theeeey will talk about us)
Find myself on the same corner that we lost 'em
Real talkin, in they ear like a Walkman
Thoughts spin around the corner, to the world
When I see them, I see my baby girl - Believe

[Chorus]

[Common] (Legend)
The Lord lives among us, the younger's hunger 
become a means to get it, by any ways nece-ssary 
Under pressure, children feelin lesser 
with the steel up on the dresser, killin will aggressors (Theeeey will talk about us)
Destiny's Children, +Survivors+, +Soldiers+
In front of buildings they eyes look older
Hard to see blessings in the violent culture
Face against weapons, sirens, holsters
That ain't the way that Langston Hughes wrote us
Soul controllers on the shoulders of Moses and Noah
We go from being Precious to Oprah (I know, I know, I know)
Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas
Today and the way that you can see we determined
Solar keeps burnin, shawty's know to keep learning
Lesson's in our life, but life stripes that we earning
Took gramp's advice that Christ is returning (Theeeey will talk about us)
Like a thief in the night, I write the beacons of light
For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys
Street hits spark rallies of the conscience conquerors 
of a contest, that seems beyond us (Theeeey will talk about us)
Even through the unseen, I know that God watches
From one King's dream, he was able to Barack us...
The prophets... Nothing can stop us, uh~!

[Chorus]

[Outro: John Legend]
I know, I know, I know how dreams won't turn to dust
Theeeey will talk about us
I know, I know, I know how dreams won't turn to dust
Theeeey will talk about us
I know, I know, I know how dreams won't turn to dust
Theeeey will talk about us {*fades*}</pre>
