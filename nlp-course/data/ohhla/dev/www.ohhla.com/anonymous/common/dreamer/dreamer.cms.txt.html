Artist: Common f/ Maya Angelou, James Fauntleroy II
Album:  The Dreamer/The Believer
Song:   The Dreamer
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro: Common]
For the world, world, world, world, world, world... Uh..
My name is Common, No I.D, ha!
 
[Common]
Uh, Ferrari testers, Armani dressers
Exquisite thick bitches, the body blessers
Rest assured, we gettin festive in Miami now
Told my nigga 'Ye I'm 'bout to win the Grammys now
Gettin Johnny +Cash+, old white folks know me now
Standin close to the mic like I'm Kobe now
We celebrate with shots-a, they hate because we got love
It's the pop life, a lot of faces pop up
Known to tear the club and the block up
Goin through the airport with more lye/lie than an opera
Knew crooks who move books like Harry Potter
Get cleaners, to get it cleaner
A +Legend+ like John, Lennon, I'm a dreamer
Tried to fuck the world she only let me finger
Mind trips to Medina, to visit the redeemer
A hero, I'll jap-out like Hiroshima
Off sangria with two broads at La Esquina
Still opening roads for Omoye and Amina
I'm a dreamer

[Chorus]
Dreaaaaaamer (It's for the world, world, world, world, world)
Dreaaaaaamer (Dream on)
I seeeeeeee her (Yeah)
Ohhh

[Common]
We take, uh, we make, uh... 
paper and build skyscrapers
Walkin on water, buildin my faith up
Niggaz with no heart, I'm the pace maker
Get the beat from No I, feel the pulse of the Chi
Survival of the fit with hope in they eye
Takin notes from the sky to fly above understanding
They notes from the Most hHgh, so I gotta land them
Career ain't random, make anthems 
Streets chant them, rock +Rolls+ like a +Phantom+
Mad hoes like they throwin tantrums
I tell 'em I need space like Richard Branson
+Dancing, With Wolves+ and +Stars+, gettin full at bars
and then pass out like a pamphlet
Never takin grants for granted
It's Common, I'm high above standard
Fly nigga, keep my feet planted
To rock the planet, I don't stop for panic
Maybe I'm a hopeless hip-hop romantic
I'm a dreamer
 
[Chorus]
 
[Common]
He introduced me, I stepped to the podium
Said, "Peace, gave thanks to the holy one"
Put my water up, thought about my daughter for a second
The youth, the living +Resurrection+
Reflections of the sun glaring through the window
Now the audi-ence staring at my mental
Feelin like the world, the world is at my fingers
'Bout to speak to an auditorium full of dreamers
Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream
To be like the king that sang Billie Jean
Now it's gold records and I'm on silver screens
At the mountaintop, you still gotta dream
To the dreamers

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Common]
It's for the world, world, world, world
Keep on, chka, da-AH, da-uh
For the world, world, world, world
Keep on, chka, dukka, da-uh
Aiyyo, aiyyo, y'all that dance to this, chka...
Keep on~!

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy II]
If I dream you're here
and you dream I'm there
We'll be nowhere near
You should just come here
If I wake you up
Only difference is
You can live the dream
Just believe in it
Oooooooh-ooooh-ooooh...
 
[Maya Angelou]
Once you find your shoulders dropping 
and your speech gets slow and hazy
You better change your way of being 
before you found your brain got lazy
You can build a better future when you join the winning team
If you desire a bright tomorrow, you must build a brighter dream
Dare to let your dreams reach beyond you
Know that history holds more than it seems
We are here alive today 
Because our ancestors dared -- to dream
From Africa they lay in the bilge of slave ships
and stood half-naked on auction blocks
From eastern Europe, they crowded in vessels overloaded with immigrants
and were misnamed on Ellis Island
From South America and Mexico, from Asia, they labored in sweat shops
From all over the world, they came to America
Many shivering in rags and still they dared to dream
Let us dream for today and for tomorrow
Let us dare to dream 
(Oooooooh-ooooh-ooooh...) 		 	   		   </pre>
