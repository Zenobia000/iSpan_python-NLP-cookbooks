Artist: Common f/ Bilal, John Legend
Album:  Be
Song:   Faithful
Typed by: jamaro05@yahoo.com

(sample) Faithful to the end
(Common) We got to be
(sample) Faithful to the end
(Common) I want to be
(sample) Faithful to the end
(Common) Yes, its for the people, God moves, yeah

[Verse 1]
I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred
What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same?  Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful

[Chorus]
(sample) Faithful to the end
(sample) Faithful to the end
(sample) Faithful to the end
(sample) I'd like to be her very best friend

[Verse 2]
He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend
Even if they don't try some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe its the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, "Why do men always have to stray?"
He said, "I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet"
"I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'"
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought, and said, "I'm tryin' to get my life together"
Went home to his lady, these were his confessions
"Baby you a blessin' and my best friend"

[Chorus]

(Bilal with his voice overlapping) Faithful to the end
(Bilal) Faithful to the end
(John Legend singing)
(John Legend & Bilal) I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be so faithful
(John Legend & Bilal) I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be so faithful

(Repeat 3x)
(Bilal) So
(Bilal) So
(Bilal) So
(John Legend) So
(John Legend) So
(John Legend) So
(John Legend & Bilal) So faithful

(Bilal) So
(Bilal) So
(Bilal) So
(John Legend) So
(John Legend) So
(John Legend & Bilal) That's what I'm gonna do
(John Legend) Faithful to the end
(John Legend) That's what I'm gonna do
(John Legend) Faithful to the end
(John Legend) That's what I'm gonna do
(John Legend) Faithful to the end
(John Legend) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</pre>
