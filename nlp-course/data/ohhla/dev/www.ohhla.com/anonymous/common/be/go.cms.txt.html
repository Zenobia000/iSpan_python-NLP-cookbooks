(Go) She was a bad (uh), the type at the club niggaz would grab her
(Go) Fantasized when I had her, in the bathroom sweatin' with her ass up
(Go) The body of a dancer, we had chemistry cuz she was a Cancer
Thought forever it would last for, but forever move faster, so I had to
(Go) Still I gotta pause when I think about her in dem draws
(Go) And a ooh baby she liked it raw and like rain when she came it poured
(Go) And like a car that I can't afford I would want it then want some more
The positions our frames explored let me know she was secure, back for more I wanna

Said there were some girls that did attract her, a new chapter she was after so I said let's
(Go) To a place that you wanna be, uh get what you want from her and me uh
(Go) Free love I wanna see uh, hot sex in the third degree uh
(Go) You gettin' served while servin' me uh, dirty words encourage me to
Rock steady and sturdily on, you turnin' me no turnin' back the further we
