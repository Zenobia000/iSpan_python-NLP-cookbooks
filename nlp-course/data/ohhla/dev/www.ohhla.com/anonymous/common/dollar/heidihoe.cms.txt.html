Artist: Common Sense
Album:  Can I Borrow a Dollar?
Song:   Heidi Hoe
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Whatup BITCH?  I'm Petey Wheatstraw
And you don't stop, with the heidi heidi hoe
Hi hoe, or bye hoe, if you're lookin for a sucker
(What are you?) I'm just another motherfucker
Pucker your lips, do flips like Mary Lou
Just because I fucked you doesn't mean that I'ma marry you
Bury you, I will do, after, I bill you
Kill you, hoe, cause your shit smells like mildew
Pe-ew, think you need some soap and a rag
Or better yet Black, Flag, you scallywag
Tag, I didn't mean to diss dis... hoe butt
But you need to stay such, do not touch
Much disrespect goes out to you
And your parents, too, for havin you
Haven't you been introduced to a douche
I guess you said fuck footloose, and got pussyloose
No juice, you shoulda dried up, like a prune-a
Mister mechanic this place needs a tune up
For the pink cadillac cause it's block is off
And have more use, than a public park
for recreation, givin up the body is a hobby
I'm tellin Santa Claus you been naughty (sing it)
Hoe hoe hoe, Merry Christmas
Aiyyo JuJu, I just had to diss dis

[Chorus]
Heidi Heidi Hoe, huh, the Heidi Hoe
All the niggaz know, yo the Heidi Hoe, c'mon
The Heidi Hoe, hah the Heidi Hoe
All the niggaz know, that you're a Heidi Hoe

(Now bring it back brotha)

Eni-meeny-meeny-meeny-meeny-meeny-miney-moe
Careful to catch a tiger, after you catch a tiger
you can catch a hoe, there's your hoe, kiss a hoe, fuck a hoe
Diss a hoe, I'm Petey Wheatstraw from the Southside of Chicago
Hablo ingles?  I don't know espanol Joe
I can go the line plus a hundred like Flo Jo
Homo's a nono, so faggots, stay solo
I roll my dick so it holds just like a Rolo
Total recall, yeah I see y'all
I see you, I see you're a freak too, so peek a boo
I'm prickin you whether or not, took you out that's work see
So get your skirt see, and bitch, dirty
Curtsey, dosey-do out the do' slut
This is what I come on, so slut you better grow up
Slow up, you forgot your earrings here take em
Salami beef and ham with the asalaam alaikum
Like that hoe (that hoe) that hoe (that hoe)
Dabba-da-dat, it's like that hoe

[Chorus]

Sittin on the dock of the bay, I say hoe
Say hoe?!  (Hoe!!)  Do you know, do you know?
Bo knows this hoe blows much much dick
An undercover trick, a toe a tac a tic
Naked at, frick-a-frat, plus her puddy wat
C'mere k-k-k-k-k-k, yo c'mere you little puddy cat
What, your booty black is so indespicable
You squaw-pie, tack-haired, motherfuckin jiggaboo
You can suck a dick or two or three or four or mo' here
But first get curlin iron burns off your forehead
My nigga Coe said, that you're an around the way girl
You're fuckin everybody around the way, and been all around the world
And you still can't find yo' fate
But you had a couple of babies I mean a Bunch like Brady
The lady is a tramp snake hoe yo and all of that
Fuck her sixty-nine you get the eighty-six and don't call me back
Your black ass bunion
There's a party in your mouth BITCH, and everybody's comin

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
