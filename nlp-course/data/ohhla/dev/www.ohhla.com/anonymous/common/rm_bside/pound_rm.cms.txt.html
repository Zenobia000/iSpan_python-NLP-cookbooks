Artist: Common Sense
Album:  Soul By the Pound 12", Resurrection 12"
Song:   Soul By the Pound (Remix)
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
"Boom it and you boom it and you boom it in your jeep" - Q-Tip
"Type of shit that hit when you pump it in your trunk" - Puba
"Boom it and you boom it and you boom it in your jeep" - Q-Tip
"Ba-bump, ba-bump, make your speakers pop!" - Reggie Noble

[Common]
I'm as bad, bad as Leroy Brown, Brown
I'm a pro p-pro, but not a noun n-noun
If you got beef, beef, you get ground, ground
Cut up in soul, soul, by the pound for pound
I'm going downtown like Julie Brown, I'm the round mound
not of rebound, but like a hound, I get down
Never wore a leash but I'm a show ya
How loose is my goose, got more soul than combat boots
("I got soul, you got it!") That's why I came
They keep callin me, man, they keep callin me, they call my name
Ese I can't - give it away, give it away now!
or say when, say what?! Or say how
Shh okay between you and me man what's all this white rap?
+I Got the Power+ and I just, I just might +Snap+
Bum ba-bum, bum bum!!
Think fast... cause I'm the Ramadan
Ahoy-he-hoy-he, I'm Fat Boy
Shibidabibidabee, boom boom, I'll be the bad boy
Having a party, but I'm not a democrat
Spoiled as a child, but now I'm milk like similak
Don't have Cinemax, because my cable's pirated
Bug out wit the rhyme, try to swat and I'll get fly wit it
For pest control, I suggest some soul
As far as dick I got it but I have no breath control
So gimme a T.O. baby like umm, Chris Webber
I got myself together
Now I'm straight, are you straight, if you straight, then I'm straight
Rock me tonight, just for old time's sake

[Chorus]

[Common]
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
Can't no A&R tell me that I ain't got soul
C'mon, can I get a clap?
Can't you see I'm trapped, and I'm so confused
Dues is gettin paid but what about the bills
I wanna make some dough yet I wanna show my skills
Do you even know where I'm goin?
I ain't scared of you motherfucker, though I am of the Omen
I jam like a Colt but make note, I'm not Koresh
cause I control minds with rhymes
So FBI don't test, I got a no. 2 pencil
and I'm a scribble all over your faaaace!
You see I don't pack no gat
I didn't see CB4 'cause I heard that shit was wack
Like +Chris+ I +Rock+, I'm strapped like my jock
Peace to No ID and my nigga Why Not!
Check it

[Chorus]

[Common]
Whoopee, look at me, I'm hipper than a hippie
Chicks flyer than the boots, so all the MC's say you make me sick
Well go see the doctor, in your car, rock my tune
Wit the Boom shak lak lak boom
I'll fire on a cracker, bayow, watch where the sparks went
Fatter than Dre, a Lover like Ed, super as Clark Kent
So gimme the +Lane Lois+ as I change clothes without a booth
And ride like this, like woof
The roof is on fire, it's not an LA riot
I got more ho, ho ho's than the jolly green giant
Large as the Professor and I'm never faking funk cock
Fat as heavy metal yet I'm harder than punk rock
So take me to a land I know not too far away
I got skills like +Tim+ and I'm coming in a +Hardaway+
So keep the crossover, Common is a b-boy
While you be dragging last, I be kicking like Bruce Leroy
Sho' nuff! Yo I got the stuff that tops the stove
And I am about to explo-o-o-ode
Who was that masked kid, that's what'cha ask kid
Petey Wheatstraw, Cutthroat, Lonnie or Rashid
But oh no, this was Common with his soul glow
Coming from Chicag- but yo I gotta go-o
The go, check, check the go (ha-ha)
The go, check check the go (yeah)
