	I'm the C-O to the double M O to the N
	You heard, motherfucker?  Well boy I hit ya again
	Official bald nigga from the City of Winds
	Stay doing it, doing it, I am doing it      (Repeat 2x)

What the fuck is going down?  Nigga you sound
Like a real bitch right now, the pound
I gave you I knew I shouldn't have gave you
Before you was a hoe now you think the money made you
A slave to the rhythm, indentured servant to wisdom
Clinton is the pres but I voted for Shelly Chisom
In a poetical prison, I'm visiting self
For hours, coward niggas get shanked for kicking
Pussy raps, radio is like CO's they try to push me back
I rip cats out of they suits, give them they hoodies back
I from the hood we stack back fist
"Ooh ohh ahh" is the sound of blackness
These new school cats is classless, influenced by rap shit
Front money, but hustle backwards
I break bread with broads that got they masters
And hypes the blaster, lawyers that work faster than young ghetto bastards
Became childlike with the way I style right
And act, because children naturally react
Respond, to the Com as a poet I'm a last like a Don
Cause I'm like that yo, a phenom without shit on my arm
You can't coherse a verse
I'm a rhyme when I want to get up and rhyme
Some say I space like John Glenn because of the places I've been
I breaks about spin, been through cases of Heinekin
Return to orbit off some shit that's anti-Corbin in the Wild Style
On to gain rappers is getting tortured for tossing salads
You imbalanced, you rap about violence too much
I go on blind dates with my estates and gold dust
And at my shows a lot shows up, they think it's a hold up
So many hands go up, but with the band I cold up
Money folder, you want a fresh style let me show you

	I'm the C-O to the double M O to the N
	You heard, motherfucker?  Well boy I hit ya again
	Official bald nigga from the City of Winds
	Stay doing it, doing it, I am doing it      (Repeat 2x)</pre>
