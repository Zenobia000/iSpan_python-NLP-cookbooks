Artist: Common f/ Cocaine 80s
Album:  Nobody's Smiling
Song:   Young Hearts Run Free
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro: Common]
State of the art, state of the drill
State of the mind, state of the city
I contemplated with wine
State of the art, state of the mind
State of the city, I contemplated with wine

[Common]
I put the line down when I put the rhyme down
Lost on my own Stoney Island where I'm found
I ride around town like this is my town
Rap to myself, tryna see how I sound
Kinda arrogant cause I'm from Chi Town
East bound it down, that’s how we get down
At the bar takin shots like they live rounds
My lifestyle is it's good to be alive now
Lot that surround me, places all cloudy
Came in the Audi, Pied Piper +Rowdy+
You in the 'Raq where it's war like Saudi
Young'ns carry the +Iron Man+, like Robert Downey
Pound the ground, we own the concrete jungle
Surround me loudly, wildy is how we came up
Thinkin 'bout the come-up
That's why I'm always on edge when the fans seem to run up
Hair all done up, we can spend the summer together
But when the weather change, lady friend
You may be forever strang-er lines seem to blur
Yea I like you but +I Still Love H.E.R.+ - uh, uh, uh~!
I come from the under, wonder why they slumbered on a nigga
Now I see the bigger picture, pour a little liquor
The rich get richer, my dick get bigger
Cause I'ma go hard, gah-go guh-go hard
The more I know self, the more I know God
Coppin land from my bro ?Monar?
Good to do business with the bro-gods, let the dollar circulate
Lower the murder rate but still kill this shit
In touch with the crib, that's why you feel this shit
The willingness to grow, the willingness to blow
The willingness to know that I don't know shit

[James Fauntleroy II]
But I still wanna know
What the fuck you on, girl?

[Common]
Enrichened souls, visions, goals, mission grows, as I do
It was written like a haiku when I was seventeen
I used the syllables, y'all, to forever dream
Now I'm a +Champagne King+ like +Evelyn+
Young hearts run free and forever sing, yea...

[James Fauntleroy II]
Tell me what the fuck you on
Cause your heart is sayin ohhh-ooo-ooh, ohhh-ooo-ooh, ohh - run

[Common] (James Fauntleroy II)
State of the art, state of the drill (And I'm down to jump the gun..)
State of the mind, state of the city (..with you)
I contemplated with wine (Tell me what the fuck you on)
State of the art, state of the mind
State of the city, I contemplated with wine
(Cause your heart is sayin ohhh-ooo-ooh, ohhh-ooo-ooh, ohh - run)
State of the art, state of the drill
State of the mind, state of the city
I contemplated with wine
It was red, I guess it had to be the bloodshed
Love shed, 'nough said

[James Fauntleroy II]
But I still wanna know ... what the fuck you on
Cause your heart is sayin ohhh-ooo-ooh, ohhh-ooo-ooh, ohh - run
And I'm down to jump the gun.. with you
Tell me what the fuck you on
Cause your heart is sayin ohhh-ooo-ooh, ohhh-ooo-ooh, ohh - run
And I'm down to jump the gun.. with you

What the fuck I'm s'possed to do when you not around
I'm not talkin 'bout when it's high, I mean on the ground
Always hold you down in and outta town
Maybe I'm a clown got me cryin out in front the crowd
On the inside but it feel like a fuckin cloud
Out my fuckin mind, I'ma fuckin drown
Girl but I'm not gonna fuck around
I'ma fuckin marry you and learn to swim
Let me carry you, I need to hit the gym
Young hard jab but the difference is
Got young love, but I'm not young
Faith in love but I'm not dumb
I don't even give a fuck about the outcome
Niggaz be scared but I’m not one...
Niggaz be scared but I’m not one...</pre>
