[Intro: Big Sean]
Ohhhhhh~! Walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin (poppin)
Champagne poppin (poppin), bad thing poppin (poppin)
Headed to the do' and ain't a damn thing knockin 
Noooooo~! (No, no) Walk up in the thing and er'rybody with me mobbin
Campaign poppin (poppin), champagne poppin (God... God.. ohh)

[Common]
I wrote this on my born day, it was a warm day
Niggaz gotta eat, we gon' do it gourmet
I'm hearin fuckin voices, like when porn play
Stay, stay on yo' grind like foreplay
What more can I say? Diamonds on for the day
That means to shine, you find a way
Stayed on porches, backyards, and gangways
Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley
Champagne ambitions
I pour it out for my man who made his transition
Wars about paper, pussy, pride and ego
Born to fly, call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though
+Boyz-in-the-Hood+ is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
My bars are my PR like Puerto Rico
This brah from the DR said I was frío
That's "ice cold" like Dre Triple Three, yo
Pinot noir star, better with time
I'm gamblin with watches getting better with time, ah~!
So I'ma ride this out for long as God allow me
They say time is money, forever is my salary
I shine tomorrow with what I do today
Yo get this money, put the diamonds on display, uh

[Hook : Big Sean]
Ohhhhhh~! Walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin (poppin)
Champagne poppin (poppin), bad thing poppin (poppin)
Headed to the do' and ain't a damn thing knockin 
Noooooo~! (No, no) Walk up in the thing and er'rybody with me mobbin
Campaign poppin (poppin), champagne poppin
Hit you with the street sweeper, now you gotta get to moppin

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Nooooo~! Ay, ay... ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Tryna get it er'ry way, er'ry day day day
Tryna get it er'ry way, er'ry day ay ay
(B-R-R-R-R!) ..Ay, ay, ay, ay
Tryna get it er'ry way, er'ry day 
Tryna get it er'ry way, er'ry day ay ay
Tryna get it er'ry way, er'ry day day day

[Common]
Cars in alignment, stars in alignment
Raw off consignment, God's in the diamonds
Evolve from the science, power and refinement
Read between the lines, hard to define us
Niggaz that's behind us, throwin up signs to signify us
In the Benz leanin like we biased
I've seen Len Bias, that shit scared me
You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never livin in the last
My time, man, precious like diamonds
Look through the glass, see what I magnify, man
I'ma be shinin 'til I die, man
I'm a rare diamond that's hard to find, man
Climbing to the mountain top, MLK day
To the streets I speak my piece like a A.K
47 to 87 to the hundreds
Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted
Dreams reflect clarity, ain't no disparity
Between peace and prosperity, so marry me - diamond

[Big Sean]
Reminiscin when I had er'rything on layaway
I'm rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day (skert! skert! skert!)
Way before the ballin that was back off in the training days
I used to hit the barber chair and say, "I need that fadeaway"
Had a crush on what's-her-name, them feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang, bangin like an 808 
Said you can't take his chain away, real player, you can't take this game away
Slang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller 
('Feller!) But you can't take my +Dame+ away 
Devil in a red dress but she got that angel face
I could teach her how to get it day to day to day to day 
(GOD~!) The G code is my combination
Catch me off in the bank, thumbin through all kinds of faces
Catch me off in court, beatin all kinds of cases
Weed, money, pussy, liquor - that's my favorite compilation 
(Diamonds!)</pre>
