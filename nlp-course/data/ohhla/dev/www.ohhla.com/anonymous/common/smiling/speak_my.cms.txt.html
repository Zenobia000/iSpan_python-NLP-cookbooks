Artist: Common 
Album:  Nobody's Smiling
Song:   Speak My Piece
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro/Chorus: sample of "Hypnotize" by The Notorious B.I.G.]
"I just speak my piece, (c'mon) keep my piece
 Cubans with-with-with this piece (thank you God), with my peeps
 Packin-n-n-n-n-n my piece, G's, packin-n-n-n-n-n my piece, G's"

[Common]
I'm iller than most, sick with it, feelin the dose
In a butter soft leather but I'm still with the toast
Toast to bros, you know the millions is close
Feel the ghost of Notorious, tell me who the naughtiest
She get live like an audience
I do what I do, no need to state the obvious
..Poli' with girls with bodies, uh!
..Poli' in hotel lobbies
Light a J, it's just me and Marley, look at the poster
Do what I supposed to for the culture
Early b-boy, down with d-boys, build and destroy
My pride and joy is my daughter named Omoy--
'Ye, that's my nigga from back in the day
All that woo-dee-wah-woo, man fuck what they say
Played the lotto for my gram with a bottle in hand
Lay it down for the world, for Chicago I stand, and..

[Chorus]
"I just speak my piece, (c'mon) keep my piece
 Cubans with-with-with this piece (thank you God), with my peeps
 Packin-n-n-n-n-n my piece, G's, packin-n-n-n-n-n my piece, G's"

[Common]
Yeah yeah, they like that 
I write raps on the top of the world
Popular girls always wanna pop in my world
I pop out in the boroughs, and go to L.A. to get +Hay+
In the middle of the barn with a princess I laid
Yo, this type of shit happens every umm.. 
Once in a while, you know I won't front with the style
Bring life to the party like a woman and child
From the land of the humble and proud, summers is wild
AHH~!! Made the unmade-able
AH~!! Go to parties I'm paid to go
Me and cuzzo talked the hustle
About doin good business like Rick and Russell
You I know I guzzle, red wine 'til it's bed time
On my paper like headlines, she want the head shine e'ry time
My time, the streets is watchin like a Rollie
Do it for the hometown and the homies, uh

[Chorus]</pre>
