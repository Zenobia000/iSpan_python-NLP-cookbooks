Artist: Common f/ Vince Staples
Album:  Nobody's Smiling
Song:   Kingdom
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro]
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom
Ooooo-ooooo-ooooo-oooo-ooo-ooo-oooo-oooo-ooo-oooh
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom
Ooooo-ooooo-ooooo-oooo-ooo-ooo-oooo-oooo-ooo-oooh
Ohh yes, my Lord, ahhh-ahh..AHH-ah-ah-ahhhhh
Ohh yes, my Lord, ahhh-ahh..AHH-ah-ah-ahhhhh

[Common]
Second row of the church with my hood on
My homie used to rap, he was about to get put on
At his funeral, listenin to this church song
His family yellin and screamin, I hurt for 'em
A cold world that's why we pack heaters
Listening to this preacher as he tryna reach us
I'ma need to go back, I gots to get 'em
Back and forth in these streets, that's the rhythm
Revenge is supposed to be the Lord's but I use my own accord
When I seen him on the porch, cost my man his life 
I can't afford not to hit him 
Shots rippin through his True Religion denim
These streets was my religion
I stood over him, his life is over then
Now these keys got me locked up with older men
Thought these was the keys for me to roll a Benz
They ended up being the keys for my life to end

[Chorus]
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (Yeah)
Ooooo-ooooo-ooooo-oooo-ooo-ooo-oooo-oooo-ooo-oooh (Sing)
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (Yeah)
Ooooo-ooooo-ooooo-oooo-ooo-ooo-oooo-oooo-ooo-oooh 
(And the streets say) Ohh yes 
(And the people say)  My Lord 
(And we all say) Ahhh-ahh..AHH-ah-ah-ahhhhh
(And the streets say) Ohh yes 
(And the people say)  My Lord 
(And we all say) Ahhh-ahh..AHH-ah-ah-ahhhhh

[Common]
My money ain't straight, my fam ain't straight
Ain't wanna push keys, heaven couldn't wait
I was hurtin, couldn't get no work
You created me from dust, that's why I did dirt
You said that the last shall be first
Now I'm in a hearse, what's this cash really worth?
My whole life I had to worry about eatin
I ain't have time to think about what I believe in
When the days of the kingdom for Chicago gon' come?
I'm comin back like the Prodigal Son, and I got a son
And I don't want my ways followin him, the streets swallowin him
And I don't want no hollows in him 
His momma said she see his father in him, hope it's the good thing
'Til life was over is when I understood things
Standin at the gates cause I know you've forgiven what I've done
I'm your son, do I have the keys to get in?

[Chorus]

[Vince Staples]
Sweet Lord Jesus, tell the polices 
to let a nigga breathe, my sinnin father see 
got a shipment by the seas, see my niggaz tryna eat 
Eat whatever's on your plate, save some for me 
The worst things in life come sittin six feet
Tryna hop the gate to heaven cause I couldn't get a key
But these niggaz play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back cause these stripes ain't free
We, still wadin in the water 
Cocaine, blunts, marinating in the water
Lean and took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I can play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell 'em talk is cheap, niggaz livin for the dollar
So in God we trust, leave the prayin to my momma though
Another motherfucker out of control, just walk in my soles
Roll, lit up with the abuse
They wasn’t for show, I promise every pistol was used
See I was wakin up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day, bare-faced, givin niggaz the blues
Nigga, who you? They know me on the streets where I grew
If you ain't from 'round here, you get gunned down here
Make the best from the least on the quest for the keys to the kingdom...

[Chorus]</pre>
