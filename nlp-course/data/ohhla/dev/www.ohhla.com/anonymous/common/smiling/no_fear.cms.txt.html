[Common]
Sittin on stairs, in street affairs
Jordan Airs, he got at least seven pairs
His voice rare, talk with a mumble
Chicago Bear hat, caught up at the huddle
Call an audible if trouble came
His name Chris, black as his hustle name
Reaction to his chains, it's like a basketball game
Watch him winnin, hope your team do the same
A +Menace+, he O-Dog, Caine
He wish a nigga would, go against his grain
Used to stayin, but moved up in the game
Take a nigga's spots, take a nigga's fame
The fortune of a caine, long live his reign
He do it for his son, he do it with a gun
Whatever he do yo, he do it 'til it's done
A team full of hitters, so they hit and run
The priest don't even want none
Walk with the Gs' cause the Gs' never run
Something to be from the slum and be the one
This is where he at, this is where he from

[Chorus]
Where I'm from, where I'm from
Where I'm from, where I'm from
Where I'm from, where I'm from
Where I'm from, where I'm from

[Common]
Livin life with no fear
Puttin that truth in my baby girl's ear
Told her that dudes gon' want some ass
And whatever you do, do it with class
She want a E, but to me, you gotta earn it
You can't circumvent life, you gotta earn it
It's the circle of life, that's why we turnin
Yo, I hear the choir and the sermon, our Messiah is returning
with the towel around my neck, a style around respect
Know the smell of good pussy and the sound of a tec
They fire, drill, stop-drop-and-roll
I popped out the cold with hip-hop that was gold
The way of the road is our ode to the legacy
C'mon dog, you know my pedigree
+Finding Forever+ +Be+, the sun never set on me
Many reign, but the game never weather me
If I'm in the building that mean I got equity
Wearing articles of black like Ebony
Since I was a shorty I was thinkin longevity
No fear, I say that with levity

[Chorus]</pre>
