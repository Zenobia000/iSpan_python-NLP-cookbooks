[Intro]
"Gluttony, baby
 Is a-to me it's what I see
 Gluttony, baby
 Is us, a sight to see two.."

[Common]
It's knockin...
Damn nigga, they gon' knock this and ride out to this, uh...

It's sittin deep in my chest, so let me express
Grew up on 868 - oh, y'all don't need the address
It was 'round CVS, we were so devious
The city never sleeps, it be needin some rest
The streets was a mess, and they still are
Feel our pain, the bigger picture, we was all framed
But the game is the game, so let it begin
In these streets, these are the seven deadly sins
Now, the first is pride, though some call it vanity
A hustler's insanity can break up the family
Pride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change
Knowin that all end up in a grave
It's the arrogance, they sayin us Americans
messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parented
Like the second of something we all have
or felt in Kane or Com, it's called +Wrath+
I seen a boss take it out on his staff
Seen a Crip take it out on a Blood, causing a bath
Never seen a man makin money while he mad
So hustle plus wrath? Y'all do the math
Now the third, you probably heard from M.O.P.
They say, "Use them rocks to make 'em envy"
Envy, the cousin of jealousy, on the streets it's a felony
When niggaz fuckin with you for committing fidelity
They hate it, to see you celebrated
Countin my paper, nigga you coulda made it!
Let me stay with that thought, takes us to the fourth
Where niggaz is lazy, that's what we call sloth
Want you to break 'em off, gettin money it costs
for you to be a boss, ain't no takin off
Now the myth about the fifth: it only happens when we eat
It's gluttony, this is how it happens on the street
It's a dude that's gettin paid in full, cars and jewels
So his plate is full, but the way this nigga move
He is never full and he gon' want yo' food
Don't overdo it, that's an underrated rule
The sixth is a fix that's in all of us
When I get drunk and wanna bust, this is what we call lust
When the drawers go down, the guards go down
Cause a pussy is somebody gettin robbed right now
Okay, the seventh is a seed that many believe
is the cause of em all, this is what we call greed
Knew some cousins that was hustlin, one of 'em ended up bustin the other
Greed is a mother, it's greedy motherfuckers like Madoff
Cops gettin paid off, greedy companies got my people gettin laid off
Before I sign off, in the sins we livin
The good thing is we can be forgiven... The seven deadly sins</pre>
