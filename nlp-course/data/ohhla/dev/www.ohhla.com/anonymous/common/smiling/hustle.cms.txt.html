Song:   Hustle Harder

[Intro: Snoh Aalegra]
Black and blue outside, his soul carries a heart of gold
Misconception 'bout what love is, she passes on
The child she brings into the world doin right from wrong 
It's all it is, all it is, she deserves more

[Common]
Red lipstick - bold, French press - cold
You know she queen bee by the way she wear her gold
Honey gettin money, the ass is stupid, she far from a dummy 
Funny I thought she came from money how she makin money
At the club, goin hard like liquor
Shots of Ciroc, she can outdrink a nigga
Niggaz dig her, think they can take her to the crib and break her,
Move her, shake her, you can't fake her, she knows time is paper
Glaciers on her neck-ah! Glaciers on her finger
Gucci purse carry notes like a singer, ah-ah
Go to the steam room and she carry a steamer, Beamer Benz 
She got friends in high ends, she know trend she know when
She go in like an investor.. yessir!
Never gettin gassed like a Tesla, ain't 'bout all that extra
Destiny brought her, to where niggaz bought her a lot of shit
She ain't caught up, bitches taught her to hustle
Hustle harder than a nigga

[Chorus]
(Uh-huh) She hustle harder than a nigga 
(True) She hustle harder than a nigga 
(Uh-huh) She hustle harder than a nigga (True)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get it-get it-get it)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get it-get it)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get it-get it-get it)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get it-get it)

[Common]
She bad, uh uh, she bad
Don't complain about it but she let you know when she on that rag
Swag like Angelina or more like Angela Bassett
Many aspects emphasis sophisticated and ratchet
She fasted for a week, that's stronger than most
If she had kids she could mother/father them both
Prominent host throw a party and she know EVERYBODY
Devil in a tight dress something there that is godly
She know what niggaz want, she know how to make 'em hunt
Hotel suite at the Trump, the way she walk in them pumps
Talkin 'bout, takin over the world while holdin a blunt
She hold her man down when her man get locked up
Prada keep movin, she movin movin and shake it like Parkinson's
Used to seel hot purses, and network marketing
Eye shadow darker than than them dudes she like
An actress her life is so movie like, she hustle harder than a nigga

[Chorus]

[Dreezy]
Uh, it's Dreezy
Look, I be livin like I need a Lamborghini
I make it happen, I would never need a genie
Went and got zucchini, threw away that fettuccine
I been goin to the gym, I'm tryna get in that bikini
I'm a, smart chick but I never wen to Harvard
I'm like a Nina got designer for my armour
Lookin for a presidential nigga like Barbara
I'm harder, at these niggaz heads like a barber
This is for my ladies whose single but got a baby
Who probably driving a Honda but savin for that Mercedes
This is for my pretty women that know that they independent
You say that her shit is rented, she probably get offended, man
The new kid like a transfer
I'm known to set trends, let 'em copy like the answers
I could be a lady in the streets but in the booth I pull triggers
Shots fired, I go harder than a.. nigga

[Outro]
Afternoon, breezy afternoon too 
The winds out west at fourteenth gusting at 22 O'Hare
High today 62, maybe some rain tonight, a low of 40 degrees
60 at O'Hare midway 61, the lake front at 60 and Wheeling sunny at 60</pre>
