[Intro]
Gotta watch out for them critters

I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live huh (x4)

[Verse One]
I was born in Chicago raised on +Planet Rock+ talking zsa zsa zsa zsa,
Cats knock my tape like beats (uh), I'm fresh as fruits
You pussy MC, it's you I rebuke, repent
You burn up you got me bend, I'm current as an event
Got on big hoes at Freaknik, frequently your telling me
Remove your rockets, so, he ain't put no scratch in my pocket
Yo herb, with my head I cock it, and rock it like that brother in Colors
Cause I want y'all to live, my Crew is 2 Live, we sneakin' to the rear
But I can't get us all in free (what?) it's just another case of that 2
dollar MC
I rock the same clothes 3 days straight to you they wrinkled but to my they
straight
Now I'm straight are you straight? I'm straight as long as I got beer
I thought about it jack, and now I'm out of here

[Chorus]
"Maintain the rock"
I get the party live, ayo Chicago get the party live
"Don't stop the rock"
"Maintain the rock"
I get the party live, '87 get the party live
"Maintain the rock"
"Maintain the rock"
I get the party live, a Common Sense get the party live
"Don't stop the rock"
"Maintain the rock"
We get the party live, U.A.C. will get the party live
"Don't stop the rock"

[Verse Two]
I need me some new socks (uhh), I need me some new drawers
I draws attention, like a letter to a Sargent
There's A Few Good MC's the wack I'm giving code red
Slim say I ain't nobody/no body but when they see me at the party they be like
"Go head, go head"
Cause I got's the cuts like Bobby, rappers are dickheads
Choppin' they demo, I do 'em like Big Red
My office hours are from 9 to 5, while you avoid the party I make it live
The fellas nod and the chicks dance
While I'm coolin' in my jumpers and my big pants
I'm as dope as PCP, MC's see me and they start having flashbacks
I don't flash scratch, I gotta watch my back
Now a days blacks don't know how to act, besides Larry Fishburn
Charles Dutton and Wesley Snipes, marks wanna test me because I test the mics
But I check 'em like sound, and like goose I'm down
Plus I done got better since +Soul By the Pound+, I maintain

[Chorus]
"Maintain the rock"
I get the party live, ayo Chicago get the party live
"Don't stop the rock"
"Maintain the rock"
I get the party live, '87 get the party live
"Maintain the rock"
"Maintain the rock"
I get the party live, a Common Sense get the party live
"Don't stop the rock"
"Maintain the rock"
We get the party live, U.A.C. will get the party live
"Don't stop the rock"

[Verse 3]
I fall fresh upon the spirit, with the lyric that's overwhelming
And house more hoes then Spellman, words I'm weldin' like James Johnston
My brains sponsorin' speech on the mic, I'm like a Jackson
Rappers I'm fondlin', they try to settle out of court
But I, could never be bought
What type of rebel eats pork?
I'll take the cat and never get caught
You wack together we fought
Cause I can't see my melons boxing if we not boxin' with 'em
I don't care who started it, I'ma be apart of it
Regardless of the odds of how hard
It's been many times we was outnumbered and we still got with them
I got rhythm from some boogers and some foxes
But a 5 becomes a 10 other brothers off some gin
I got juice, and this niggas scared
I'll F your head up, like the L.A. 4
When I flow like cash I got for broke
like Melba Moore
Why should a male with a B.A. get more then me?
When Rashid got an MC degree, and a doctorate in rockin' shit I go to docs
to get
A fishwich with cheese, I don't mix with MCs
Cause I just don't like them mother....
But I'm still maintaining

[Chorus]
"Maintain the rock"
I get the party live, ayo Chicago get the party live
"Don't stop the rock"
"Maintain the rock"
I get the party live, '87 get the party live
"Maintain the rock"
"Maintain the rock"
I get the party live, a Common Sense get the party live
"Don't stop the rock"
"Maintain the rock"
We get the party live, U.A.C. will get the party live
"Don't stop the rock"</pre>
