Artist: The Roots & John Legend f/ Common, Melanie Fiona
Album:  Wake Up!
Song:   Wake Up Everybody
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

{*33 seconds of instrumental to open*}

[John Legend]
Wake up everybody, no more sleeping in bed
No more backward thinking, time for thinking ahead
The world has changed so very much, from what it used to be
There is so much hatred, war and poverty
Ohhhhh yeahhh yes

[Melanie Fiona]
Wake up all the teachers, time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen, to what you have to say
Cause they're the ones who's comin up and the world is in their hands
When you teach the children, teach them, the very best you cannn
Ohhhhh yeah

[Chorus: Legend & Fiona together]
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me

[John Legend]
Wake up all the doctors, make the old people well
They're the ones who suffer, and who catch all the hell
They don't have so very long, before their judgment day
So won't you make them happy, before they pass away?
Ohhh yeahhh

[Melanie Fiona]
Wake up all the builders, time to build a new land
I know we can do it, if we all lend a hand
The only thing we have to do, is put it in our minds
Surely things will work out, cause they do every time
Yeahhhh-heahhhhh

[Chorus]

[Common]
It's the God hour, the morning I wake up
Just for the breath of life, I thank my maker
My mom say I come from hustlers and shakers
My mind building on skyscrapers and acres
He said take us back to where we belong
I try to write the song as sweet as the psalms
though I'm the type to bear arms and wear my heart on my sleeve
Even when I fail in God I believe
Read the days and, weave through the maze
And the seeds are so amazing, feed them and raise them
Seasons are aging, earthquakes, wars and rumors
I want us to get by but we more than consumers
We more than shooters, more than looters
Created in his image so God live through us
And even in this generation living through computers
Only love love love can reboot us

[John Legend + Melanie Fiona]
Ohhhh wake up everybody no more sleeping in bed
Ohhhh wake up everybody yeahhhh
Gotta get up, gotta get up
Said I need a little help, everybody, no more sleeping in bed
I need a little help, everybody, c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
I need a little help y'all! Can't do it alone
Oh I need a little help y'all! Gotta get up, gotta get up
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
Wake up everybody, wake up everybody
Wake up everybodyyyy, yeah</pre>
