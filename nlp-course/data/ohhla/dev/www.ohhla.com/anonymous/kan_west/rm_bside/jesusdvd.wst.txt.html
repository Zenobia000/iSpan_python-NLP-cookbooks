Song:   Jesus Walks (DVD Remix)

Come on!
God show me the way now the devil can't break me down
Jesus walk with me

[Verse One: Kanye]
Between the girls and the jewelry
The devil trying to lure me
A view of me
(Jesus walks with me)
My pastor shaking his head
He ain't sure of me
But surely
(Jesus walks with me)
Then he asks, "Do you say your prayers at least two a week?"
I ain't talking to God I know what I've been doing G
Do you know how I be embarrassed?
My friends sound like Ben Stiller's on Meet the Parents
And I ain't good with that Give us our day"
The slaves was trying to give us our free
I'm trying to give us "us pay"
Now you know how them strippers was
We was all ghetto-fabulous all at the rooms at the Sybaris
From this Jacuzzi water can you cleanse us?
Can you please unfog my Cartier lenses?
God sends signs sometimes only in glimpses
For me I almost died, falling asleep in them Benzes
There's something about this beat that get me tranquilized
And when I play it at my shows I feel sanctified
And He gives me direction when I can't decide
He is alive!
How can you tell me he ain't when I, said...

[Chorus]
(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus Walks)
The only thing I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus Walks)
And Now I think there's something I can say now that will right my wrongs
(Jesus Walks)
I finally talked to God and I ain't afraid cause his love is so strong

[Verse Two: Common]
Open your eyes
The smoke in the skys
The beast is tokin' the lies
Everywhere we move, motion's denied
Emotions deride from potions of pride
Of African, cultures and tribes
Who livin' when we supposed to have died
We laugh when we supposed to have cried
Of pain we holdin' inside
Cause all we really know is survive
Use that to remember we kings
That's why we so addicted to diamonds and rings
And Cutlass Supremes
Seen Diana Ross and remembered that my sister's is queens
The Lord is comin'
But now he visit in dreams
With every Mission it seems Impossible
Spit the gospel to remind me what God can do
When it's not logical
To those in hospitals and prisons
Low income livin'
For them I say a prayer, keep givin'
Learnin' to receive
My heart is burnin' to achieve
Even when it's hard to breath
I still believe that...

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Ma$e]
Before you take me name, take my fame
Why you had to take my shame, take my flaws, take my blame
Feel my dirt, conceal my hurt, See my bruise, and this you walk in my shoes
You weren't there when I was in deep thought
When I had two choice, kill him or either leave New York
But I'm a truth tella and that's why I say what I'm sayin'
And the only thing the radio playin' is cause you be payin'
It ain't about who really hot no more
Beats would knock no more
So who cares who flop no more
I realize that most labels pay you for lies
And all that blood do is gain disguise
That you're favorite artist shhhh
I know you hear that huh you wanna fear that what
Your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that
Kan the rap slash John the Baptist
Prepare the way for what I came to say today
They deceived us, had us thinking Jesus really didn't need us
When he loved up all you
He loved them boys in hallway up in Broadway
Even those who meet him for dope every four days
To the strippers in broad day up in Norway
To the Detroit player Gators in Moreys
With me its not just bars and music I walk with God
I have the scars to prove it

[Chorus]

“Father I thank you, for forgiving me, for everything I
ever done, for Jesus walking with me, for dying for me
raising for me, and all my sins have been forgiven
I'm a changed man, I'm healed I'm delivered
I'm rich and It's all because of him" Now
Walk with me, Walk with me,Wha Wha Walk with me Walk with me</pre>
