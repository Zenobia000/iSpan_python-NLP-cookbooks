[J Dilla]
Yeah
Let's go
Turn it up
Introducin'
World famous beat junkie
Jayyyy Dilla
Yeah
I got my man with me

[Common]
Get up get up, and rock, and rock
The humm the humm and knock and knock
You out the atmosphere
This rap here something that I felt in the moment
Of truth, opponents in the booth
Inspired, is what I write, fire like 'roof'
They say that I'm as hot as the block is
I say that I'm as cold as the dark is
Moms sit in the cut
Tryin' to get my niggaz in the den he walked by
Hold his stoony up
Hole in his +Chest+ like Cody +Nutt+
Smoking his cess, he blow it up
As if schemed out the window lobby
Similar sex, revolution and techs on the death
When niggaz shoot for extra loot and respect
Live and direct effect from the C-O
Double get your paper 	
We stay up out of trouble nigga

[J Dilla]
Get up stand up throw you fuckin hands up
If you got the feelin' jump up touch the ceilin
Get, get, get up get up
Get get get, get, get up, get up yeah
Get up stand up throw you fuckin hands up
If you got the feelin' jump up touch the ceilin
Get, get, get up get up
Get get up, get, get up, get up, get up yeah
Get up stand up throw you fuckin hands up
If you got the feelin' jump up touch the ceilin
Get, get, get up get up
I get get, get up, get up yeah

[Common]
Get up niggaz, get live ladies
Since the early 80's I rock the planet daily
Radio Rasheed this is how I do when I write things
The party for your right to fight scenes
Baby girl you as young as the nice seams on tight jeans
Should have been Kahlua or ice cream
My pipe dream's long as the fight scenes in The Matrix
Scorpio rising, sex fiend by nature
Try to control that shit so my soul don't get
Dirty for some girly, unworthy of the flowers
I admit that I got strange powers
Brain showers
Like the Eiffel, leaning thru life cycle
Hold the bible and a rifle
That they do me might go
Get me in the spotlight, turn the lights low
Make you wanna holler like tooti
I abuse the disciple
Beats, streets meets speaks mind, times and life yo
get up

[J Dilla]
There it is
Uh
It's like that
Yup, yeah know how we do it</pre>
