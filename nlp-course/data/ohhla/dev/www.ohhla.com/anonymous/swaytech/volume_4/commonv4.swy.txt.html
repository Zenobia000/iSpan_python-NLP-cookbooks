[Common]
Yeah, I act like heroin, I prepare lines
For those who never knew about the flow up on this
Common Sense, evolution right up on the mix
The revolution will not be televised
This is what I do, I tell the guys
I never tell no lies, I'm the truth
Sittin' across the table from corporate lies
I said that in the sixth sense
Yo I go on and on like a run-on sentence
Common Sense is searchin' for repentance
From a lot of wach brothers
It's like this, I used to love her
I remember the brother who had his mother on the record cover
The last album, one day it made sense
Common Sense is comin' like ths for the present
What can I do when I see these pretty ladies
If I see one good enough Im stab like Jay-Z
Ah man I gotta chill with that
That ain't what went down, Common Sense sense sounds around
Come on now gotta chill
You can't tell that I'm down with K-Mell
Or flip it, you know how we gel
Common leader, check it out Common Sense will feed ya
A little bit of rhymes, people know the times
I'm rhymin' great, my album's comin' on the 28th of March
Y'all, it's like that baby what

[Talking]
Yeah, he's still in there, he's still in there
I wanna hear something written
OK, OK, OK check it

[Common]
Women cry, children laugh, men dance
I refuse to lose self tryin' to win fans over
Weight on my should fluctuates like Oprah
My refridgerator poetry magnetic like Ultra
You couldn't hang if you was a poster

[Talking]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright, what's next on the mic

[Common]
Yo bust it, Denzi, Benz jeep, ten freaks behind em'
M P's and rhymin' M 3's and dimin'
Empty ya nine if you attempting to rob them stars
While they getin' money from Mr. Long Island
Give me that paper dog, I gotta have it
Might lift a pocket so money is automatic
We the fourth of carats
And you still lookin' sort of savage
It's a whole lot of money out there you aught to grab it
Alright, rippin' on the mic
All night put my nigga Sway on the mic</pre>
