[Intro]
Yeah
Sway and Tech nigga
My name is 5'9
Y'all been in the game for a minute
Shout out to GangStarr
What up Prim' (back to basics)

[Chorus]
A lot of shit has happened, since I started rappin
A lot of shit has happened, since I started rappin
A lot of shit has happened, since I started rappin
There's been enough beef, and enough gat clappin

[Royce da 5'9]
Yeah
I'da became a target
From the bottom became the hardest artist in the game
The first time they started to market my name
I started to change
Smart but hardly could think logically
The insane part of me layin inside of me says pardon
me so I part with the same side of me
I hang out with the same guys
Either they not noticin the game changin me or they ain't watchin me
Bitches sayin, "hi" to me
Niggaz who ain't hot as me
Picturin me slain niggaz gettin plain tired o' me
Lookin down at 'em when he got the same drive as me
We the same niggaz aim just as high as me
Everything is the same with us but the thing is that I
came in here with a different anxiety
Hopefully the day I retire is approachin me lookin
back like those were the days I was fly
(But y'all gon' learn) from the mistakes to wait and
to be patient wrong turns did take up a lot of time
But I finally found my way around now I'm wiser
I thank God that I made it out alive

[Chorus]

[Common]
One man rises another falls
To discover all is one and one is all
I come to call like Jericho with the trumpets
It's wild and the honeys gramps and the Kwa hummin
The Lord soon comin
From glow some grow
Many stay stunted songs with the shorties knowin
I learn from the keep the dumb shit from my circumference
I run with niggaz that wanted and done it the hunted and blunted
L said it gotta come from the stomach
To me the stomach is the voice of the Lord
The revolutionary people's choice the award
Seein souls move forward
Ghosts move toward new homes and new floors for us to rise to
In the attic tapin up my Bible thinkin I cannot apply to survival
The un-American Idol seein by the size of those times
I put it in my rhymes
A lot of shit has happened

[Chorus]

[Chino XL]
Yo, welcome lambs to the slaughter
It's the most important moment in my life since the birth of my daughters
Regardless, all is well in the universe put man
track, and Chino who cannot spit a wack verse
My first CDs basically made me Marky Mark with the
whole planet of the apes chasin me
Here to save you all now rap ain't worth savin but I
can't get the pavement with gay shit like Craig David
Vocal arrangements even basic I'm still the hottest
nigga to spit inside of my cousin Tigga basement
I've no replacement for what's seeming like ages
I ain't no hypochondriac complainin I stay sick
Standin ovations for acapellas shitiations
I get better with agens everybody's observation
Starvation to brawl the last samurai
Take an eye for an eye till the world goes blind I'm bovine
Raging bull words are my weapons hoping not over ya head like cangos in '87
I move from Jers' to Cali' fillin the love
Move moms to Miami promised I would
Beef 'n drama i've been you wouldn't last through
What's funny motherfucker I wanna laugh too
But now I'm ready to get rich old dog new tricks
Told L could dig to China with chopsticks
When I switch to the big leagues this year with no fear
Cuz who'd even believe that I'd be here

[Chorus]</pre>
