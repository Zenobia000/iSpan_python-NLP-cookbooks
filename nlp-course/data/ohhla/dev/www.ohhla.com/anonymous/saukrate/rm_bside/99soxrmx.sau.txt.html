Artist: Saukrates f/ Common Sense
Album:  Underground Tapes Vinyl EP (Limited Edition)
Song:   Play Dis (99 Sox Remix)
Typed by: graumit@hotmail.com

CHORUS [Saukrates]
Little piece of sumpin'
    "Play" <-- Saukrates
    "Orginial rap" <-- KRS-One
    "Play" <-- Saukrates
Little piece of sumpin'
    "Play" <-- Saukrates
    "Hardcore in hip-hop" <-- KRS-One

[Saukrates]
Amazed dudes to wack crews
Lay it down
Kids could never walk a mile in my shoes
Shorties clockin' me
Always be coming in the two
Niggas from the north
I'm bringing you tracks and good news
My debut was real to the blind industry minds
Who never had the time
Now kids press rewind to the top
But legally I gotta show love
Call me A, B and C, the answers D
All of the above
I attack the microphone like Jack Ripper
Real for stacks, leaving kids no headroom like Max
Try to react, but you were never calm
And never, could kick a verse
When worse come to worse I'm better
Shine like genuine rhine and black patented leather
On half naked honeys who forgot about the weather
Fuck an exhibition, and warm up scrimmage
Shoot more words that Macho Man spit gism in the village

CHORUS

[Common Sense]
Stimulated by a tree and drama
I advanced on a branch of respect and honor
A patient of the Ill state
Sittin' in trauma, never been one to side with hama (yeah)
For Armageddon, I'm getting armed plus armor
The comma of matter on the rise like a tip in the southside diner
Your preference to the book of life that likes to pack humid
To it I react by staying strapped with the mack and courage
Parallel to a carrousel of murders
I prefer to make a life than take a life
Stopped at a street called Wise and made a right
Sort of how I play my broads, just how I play the mic
First I cuff it, then finger fuck it
Check it something rugged, other niggas be reluctant
To touch it after me
Passively they strike, never matching me
Rapidly, don't placidly
I fabricate the verbal tapestry
Tap the keg of your conscious
Navigate niggas like Farrhakan with a compass

CHORUS

[Saukrates]
Kids setting their watches 5 minutes fast to stay
On top of time, but I'm already 10 minutes away
Nigga play what you want to play, he say she say
But Saukrates got the buttas in T dot O dot today

[Common]
Slowly but surely I pour the lyric into the glass of your mind
My rhyming will be the diamond that will cut through
Lines say but you to do, you don't know what to
Got wisdom like a tooth
Incidentally I get buck too
Didn't get my jest, so I just had to do it
My mic or your mic, come on no congruent
Seen broads in brew to me, be jubilee
On my neck be hot jewelry
My old man be schooling me
For sho' I rock good, cats claim this hood and that hood
Black man, your hood is the universe
On this Earth, you were first through the worse
My crew could hearse
Used to go up stairs and we went through the purse
I don't cures around juniors
Spread live like rumors
Niggas loved my tape, but how many were consumers?

[Saukrates]
Shout out to honeys working them hourgalss hips
Stay soprano, reading surano
Dramatic episodes, yo Common
Let me play with niggas brains like clay kits
When I rock stage hits
Skip the rumors and lies
So you're under the stairs
When I drop my hip-hop, you'll be some Maytag repairmen
And flip flop the fake, who thought the scored
And half-assed niggas sending you back to drawing boards
To deliver the real shit, at least we'll spit on your mic
I'm versatile like a plate of read grits
