Artist: (Big Sean f/) Common
Album:  Detroit (Mixtape)
Song:   Story By Common
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yea, what up! It's Common right here! Y'all know where I come from, and uh, shoot I used to come to the D
I used to go to Detroit, like, every two weeks to record with J Dilla
I be standing at the Atheneum, and then, you know, he'd come scoop me up; he had a Range
We'd either eat, we'd eat at a Coney Island, close to his crib
He stayed 'round McNich'
We'd go down in his basement and stuff, and Jay Dee would dig through the records and then he would make a beat
And then once he make a beat, I'd be like, "Yo that beat cold," and then I'd just sit there
And Frank, Frank would be around
And then you know, and we'd just be kicking it; I'd be getting some Heinekens and stuff
and then uh, they'd go to Chocolate City, to strip club
And I wasn't all into the strip clubs at the time, so I'm like yo
I'd just be like, I'd sit there and be like, "I'm about to write this rap."
Then one time I was like, "I'm going to the strip club with y'all."
I went to the club, and man they had some good chicken wings
man some good, thick girls, and it was right
Anyway, I love the D, man; We used to kick it off in the D
That was like all day
That's what we do</pre>
