Artist: Kid Cudi f/ Kanye West, Common
Album:  The Man on the Moon: The End of the Day
Song:   Make Her Say
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Chorus: Lady Gaga's acoustic version of "Poker Face" sample] (Kid Cudi)
(I make her say...) Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh oh
(When I..) Pa-pa-pa-poker face, pa-pa-poker face/poke 'er face
(I make her say...) Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh oh
AH-AH-AH-OH-OH..
(Whaddup..) Pa-pa-pa-poker face, pa-pa-poker face/poke 'er face

[Kid Cudi - Verse 1ne]
Me first...heh!
Uh, uh-uh, she wanna have whatever she liiiike (liiiiiike)
She can if she bring her friiiiiend (friiiiiend)
and we can have one hell of a niiiiight, through the day
Ay, I mean starin like a creeper 'cause you got a peep 'er
I mean you pro'lly might be sayin you ain't jockin either
But man, ol' girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, the type to make you tell a bitch +Just Dance+
And FUCK them other niggaz 'cause you down for her bitches
FUCK them other niggaz 'cause she down for the stickin
And FUCK them other niggaz, hope she down for some lickin
And FUCK them other bitches 'cause she down for the trickin
Loooove, I'm hopin she a rider
When it's said and done, hope she spit it up and swallow noooooow
I ain't gotta trip about the niggaz who like her
'cause me and mami know who could really make her goooooo...

[Chorus w/ different ad-libs]

[Kanye West - Verse 2wo]
(What she talkin 'bout, 'Ye?)
She said she want whatever she liiiiike
She said she gon' bring her friiiiend
and we gon' have a hell of a niiiiight, through the day, I made her say
Hold up (yea?), born in '88 (Word?!)
How old is that? (Man!) ...Old enough
I got seniority wit the sororities
So, that explain why I love college
Gettin brain in the library 'cause I love knowledge
When you use your medulla, oblon-gata
And give me scoliosis/skull-iosis until I comatoses
And do it while I sleep, yeah a little osmosis
And that's my +commandment+ you ain't gotta ask Moses
More champagne, more toasts-es
More damn planes, more coasts-es
And fuck a bus, the Benz is +Parked+ like Rosa
Osa...

[Chorus w/ different ad-libs]

[Common - Verse 3hree]
She said she want whatever she liiiike (liiiike)
But you gotta bring your friiiiend (friiiiend)
and we can have one hell of a niiiiight, through the day
She +Blamed It+ on the al-ah-ah-al-ah-alcohol
She had her hair did, it was bound to fall
Down, down for a damn, Cudi already said it
A poker face book, I'd already read it
But man, her head was +G.O.O.D.-er+ than the +Music_
Electro body known to blow fuses
A stripper from the South, lookin for a pay day
Said, "Bitch, you should do it +For the Love+ like Ray J."
"But they say, you be on that conscious tip"
Get your hair right and get up on this conscious dick
I embody everything from the Gali to the party
It's the way I was raised on the Southside Safari, so

[Chorus w/ different ad-libs]

{Lady Gaga's "Poker Face" sample} (Repeat 4X)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read-a my
Poker faaaaaaace
She's got me like nobody</pre>
