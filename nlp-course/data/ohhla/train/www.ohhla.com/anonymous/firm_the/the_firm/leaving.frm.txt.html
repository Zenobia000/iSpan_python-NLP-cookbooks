Artist: The Firm (Nature) f/ Noreaga
Album:  The Firm
Song:   I'm Leaving

[Noreaga]
yo, Nori know this, and Nori know that
but Nori know gat (why)
cause Nori buck dat
Iraq'll make you famous
throwing gang signs like it's sign language
distinguish us from the others
kidnap your baby mothers
bringing drama to the deep covers
salute g, bust you down like a lucie
Jose probably lay with a gold uzi
crunk Italy, Africa and Sicily
niggaz acting sissy see
pointing guns and missing me
(Nas:  "Yo son, it's on son")
hey yo there's beef in the hood again
niggaz came with hoods again
thinking that it woulda been
saw us, from what we first did
when we did
now we twist another wig, a mother lose another kid
but it's beef now, keep it short
real brief now
strike vigorous, no intentions of missing it
they sent the message, or example, whatever
set it up man on man
only to score we apply the plan
quickly explain why you ran in this dark land
we lay you down in the sand
on the lines like the internet
many would come if you would pose off
against my set, there ain't a nigga yet
smoke so much, niggaz say I need nicarette
you say bogie but you used to say cigarette
nine-oh, a new religion, a new beginning

[chorus]
I'm leaving

baby don't go
I know the block is hot
boo I'll watch your spot

I'm leaving
sweetie don't leave
I need you to stay with me (come on)

uh huh, uh, uh
uh huh, uh, uh
I'm leaving

boo I can't understand

and don't think that I'll be back again

[Nature]
it's like a bad dream
and I can't wake up
mouth caked up
knowing these cats is fake fucks
and it ain't right
with no love, them hugs ain't tight
son we used to pop bottles and slugs the same night

[Noreaga]
hey yo they left me
right hand damaged and I ain't lefty
couldn't bust when I's supposed to pull
what I'm supposed to do?
lay down, watch these niggaz spray me
or maybe
we strike accurate
blaze them plus they ladies

[Nature]
I woulda never thought we'd ever get caught
in this way of life
prosecution, if you violate a player's rights
say it twice
Nature soon to be engraved in ice
hanging off my neck
glistens like it's framed in light

[Noreaga]
niggaz call me Jose
shootin the Artie Clay
Benedict Arnold type
getting this rap loot
still selling China White
either Allah or Christ
married to marijuana
now my niggaz don't write
(still ice, still living this life)

[chorus]

[Nature]
you got the nerve to say that Nature's slipping?
the greatest vision
bald-head kid
Cartier frames, the latest Pippens
doggystyle was my favorite position
until I switched it, dead shit
got on some head shit
headed in the wrong direction up in the Sheraton
QB to LA still puffing my medicine
for those lost in the streets up north or deceased
for those struggling unfortunate to eat
I dedicate this, tell me right now how do you rate this?
whatever happened to the mule and the 40 acres
it's outrageous, the way the god finesse the basics
invasion, me and Noreaga Firm made men</pre>
