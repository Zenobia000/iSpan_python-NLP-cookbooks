Song:   Things You Do

Q Tip Talking:
Lets talk about these things we see
Walking across the land
Lets talk about these joints I got 
Every body get down 
Lets talk about these things we see
Lets talk about these joints I got

Chorus:
Lets talk about the rules I bring
And the things we take
And the jobs we hold 
And the land we stole
And a buck or two
And the love for you
And the things you do (5X)

I puff L's with ladies and gentlemen
I break spells with faith in a burst of wind
Others talk but.what they talk about?
Who could walk but live what they walkabout
A calm head in the middle of wartime
People go down just so they could get more shine
Girls wave your flag and surrender your faculty
Niggaz got geez but its not really mack to me
Keep it soft like we killers and often gat
You walking on me guaranteed you be crawling back
Abstract see it like this is the king in you
Allies living one more if I'm fuckin too
Dogs don't eat it up increase they feedin time
I'll be damned if a mutt starts eating mine
Let's stay clubbed out the moon makes it whistle
Pants gripped your ass now I hope they don't fall apart
Look around you tell me who else is shining girl
Fat rapping cats on my dick they just whining girl
That's just the magnetism that a Queens fella has
Range rover gism and he fronting with his Lexus ass
But watch imma drop to a bronco
See me in your Bentley nigga just honk yo!
And just know that your man to can get that
And just though that I don't really wet that
And just know that this nigga here flips tracks
Ooh what, whose ya, pain and slip dat
The illest regiment is what I represent
Get us mad you gonna see the way gorillas went
Mactime I need a diamond at least a friend
I fear Allah he has no start and he has no end
We raise the roof up and tear the fuck up off
Bucking hard like the coast guard, who's soft?

Repeat chorus  (3X)</pre>
