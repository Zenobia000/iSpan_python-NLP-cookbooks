"Hmmm, so you're the one they're talkin' about. 
Let me see if this is real."

[Q-Tip]
When I do it, eyes lookin' at me when the
music should be the only thing you see. It's the
score to a cinematic oddity. Lettin'
off shit, hit your ass repeatedly. Acro-
batic, wha. I'll pull something through your chest-piece.
Before she came home, pit-stopped breast be.
Watched the movie, and smoked a philly and
took a hit of D. She actin' all silly and...
I pull the brothers in depressed situations. When the
thang hit the 'phere, we risin' up to the occassion.
You're killin' me wit' petty, little rap beat.
'No fingerprints' is how my expert-ass be.
While I'm at it, I'ma stand my ground right
here. Spotlight, where the chicks is found.
You see this little-ass club we in? Yo, it's
mine, intertwine, wink your bun, do it to the drum.

[Jessica Rivera]
"Yeah, that's alright. 
But I know you can do better than that! C'mon! C'mon!"

[Q-Tip]
Aiiight then. I guess we stand the same ground, same
page and wanna freak shit. I wanna
eat it, watch you beat it, cum
real hard than repeatin'. Yo!
The frivolous rap song he rap about
is no good. Remove all the crap about
my dogs is all in for the national.
No passion, then I guess they be cashin' out.
I keep my eyes on things and
I keep my shine on BLING!
My peoples ain't nothin' to toy wit'.
Professional, leavin' a boy stiff.
You doin' all while you're really talkin'.
You need to get gun or get walkin'.
This greedy-ass country we in? I guess it's
mine, intertwine, wink ya bun, do it to the drum.

[Q-Tip]
"So, I was wondering what would happen...how would you feel if
I...came inside your bedroom, I took off all your clothes, and
took all mines off. And, uh, I got the portable DVD thing...
and...got the...right connections. I stick it in and put on top
your spa basing to get you all fucked up over the bounce. And
then, you can take it off and then..."</pre>
