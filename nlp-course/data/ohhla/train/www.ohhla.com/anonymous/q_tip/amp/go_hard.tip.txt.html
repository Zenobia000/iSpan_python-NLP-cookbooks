[Q-Tip]
now picture this a man wit his whole thing in order
movin through life at will he ill 
he make his own teeth growl wit his generous style
but he still no joke wit his wisdom and smile
givin pounds all around no need to act foolish
enjoy the time no need to get toolish
i spit it out wit the general feelin that
once u vibe wit it then you keep on comin back
the north south and east and the west
wanna see which crew can do it the best
Is it the North, where people drink juice and Smirnoff?
Girls go hard but they lips stay soft 
the west where cats throw jets to play
smokin green all day keep a loked out sway
east..side..the hustle get real 
pretty young things with their mass appeal
or the south where thugs keep gold in their mouth
big ol' girls with their thang hangin' out
whatever it is I hope you evolve 
we gon push it to my level let the G evolve come on

Chorus: [Q-Tip]
Go..go at..go at it hard..real hard

[Q-Tip]
everybody take note to your man and ya'll
and I will take note to the grand
it's venomous I mean the way they hate
they can't wait for my to mize me meet my great but
no attention I give them no light
niggas gotta know that I go through mics
go through walls with sounds and speakers with real drives
You can't fuck this nigga from Tribe a yo
I put my mind to the work in here
and make sure that all of ya can understand
that I don't do bitch, I don't do tricks
I stay doing beats while you stay layin' bricks
I do do the things that keep me from the rest
and I do that well if I do suggest yo
put your hands on your system and feel me out
or put your hand on your money and hold your cloud
the indoor seat of lady galor seas 
she get touched once and she'll never divorce me
hey clear your brain as I implimate raw thoughts
you shouldn't be aware that I don't get off course
stayin' steady on it niggas ain't ready for it
flourin' it hard with A.J. Pettite on it
a noble's face and I'm doing my pace
makin' sure all my conrads get a true taste
what?.. a good shit and I'm ringing your memory
we goin' hard yo and that's how it need to be
so wake up and take that sleep outcha eyes my friend 
here's the mot-to in your ear hear this again

Chorus 

heavy hitters knockin shit out the park
you didn't even really play tell me why did you start</pre>
