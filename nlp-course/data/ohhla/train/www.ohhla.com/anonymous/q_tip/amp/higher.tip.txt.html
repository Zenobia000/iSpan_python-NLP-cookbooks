Take you (higher)
Hit you (higher)
Make you (higher)
Hit you (higher)
Take you (higher)
  
I don't know what to make of this
Funny brothers on my nerves type ridiculous
I guess I really gotta do it
Put my game down
?????? fucking blew it
Put my name down
And it seems you fucked up like a drug deal gone wrong
Figured out a lot, you won't be that way long
Plus, you niggas is bush leaguers
And I bet y'all ain't get no bush either
My hood dogs sing songs of rejection and pain
If we get sunshine, it's followed up by rain
Like to lay your jig down and get a blessing of brains
My man ???? so he stressing your chain
We see the 'morrow through the shades of it might not come
Got to get it all now 'cause we might be done
Matrix, nigga (nigga...), you looking at the one
Fortified with a bonafide blastin' of a gun
We in the space for positionin'
Money and illiciting
Living out our lives while certain cats just lookin' in
We bewildered off the sacks and the green
Whether the bay, L.A., or  Chicago or Queens
You better raise your game
They comin' at you high
You better raise your game
Don't ask no questions why, nigga
Then speak figuratively, I mean this shit
And speak literally, you in some shit
  
(Higher) take you
(Higher) hit you
(Higher) make you
(Higher) hit you
(Higher)
  
I dominate flows
I dominate shows
And, in the nightime our dominance grows
And, you could see from the posture I'm holding
Yo, I'm ???? up while the rest is folding
A hip hop cat who's flown world wide and
Experience, adventures like poseidon
Bunk heads with r and b chicks
Give 'em one hit joints and they lookin' for the remix
The shit that I spit like plain clothes days
Surprised you legit make your whole team freeze
I'm so irregular
Ear on the cellular
Let's celebrate 'cause your man is a hell of a
Fillin' the blank with a good thing to fill in
We hold it still 'cause we walkin' with still (chance, chains???)
Blindsided up in your own reality
While we in the heat of the moment, fuck morality
I really wanna see you rise to my joint ma (ma)
I'm lookin' straight don't see your eyes get my point ma (ma)
However you do it, I'm doing you back
Yo, don't misconstrue it, 'cause I'm screwing it back
Yo, rappers better count my presence as they down time
I gotta move around, don't have no fuck around time
So, you better just get on back
just (incoherent scats) abst'act
  
Aiyo, (higher) take you
(Higher) hit you
(Higher) make you
(Higher) hit you
(Higher.........)
  
Uh, uh...higher......we gettin' higher
Yeah.....higher......
  
Yo, one more time
I don't know what to make of this
Funny brothers on my nerves type ridiculous
I guess I really gotta do it
Put my game down
???? fuckin' blew it
Put my name down
And it seems you fucked up like a drug deal gone wrong
Makin' out a lot, you won't be that way long
Yeah yeah, plus, y'all niggas is bush leaguers
And I bet y'all ain't gettin' no bush either
And I bet y'all ain't gettin' no a-hoop either
