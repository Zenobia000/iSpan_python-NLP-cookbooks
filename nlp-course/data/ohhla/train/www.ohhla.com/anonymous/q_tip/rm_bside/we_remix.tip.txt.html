Artist: Q-Tip f/ Kanye West
Album:  We Fight We Love 12"
Song:   We Fight We Love (Remix)
Typed by: timm2014@hotmail.com

[Verse One: Kanye West]
Hip hop, uh
When I fight you fight
We don't fight fair
So I guess I'll See You In My Nightmares
Just remember I made you like my Nike Air
Ye... Yeezys
Please be easy
To kill the animosity that's in the air
I'll touch every curve of your body like an ?herbalist yeah?
And this wasn't no ordinary love
Our sex wasn't ordinary drugs
It's that crack, that crystal meth
I mean it gets so wet, I had to go in depth
I mean the bitch so fresh I had to go in debt
Ru-running my credit card till there's no more left
Uh but that's cool, you wife and I'll be groom
I thought I had a sign a Seal like Heidi Klum 
Like Jay and B
Like Chris and Ri
But this Christmas you'll be missin' me

[Verse Two: Q-Tip]
He walks outside for a cigarette break,
And thinks how many cigarettes does it take
He takes a long drag with the sun in his eye
He squints, he thinks, he starts to sigh
Sometimes he cry
When he thinks about his girlfriend on his side
She held him down
She made him better
For the love fucked up weather (?)
And she thinkin' about the life
With no more work just being the wife
But instead, her love she gave it to a man
Who fought against her lovely plans
So when she goes to work
Plus go to school
Plus fight for love she must feel like a fool
She want the ease to come after pain
She fights for love that's her campaign

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Q-Tip]
Word word yo
I try to stick it out with her through thick and thin
So whether she was thick or thin I was still stickin' in
But like when I left shorty with the rest of my friends
I guess all good things had to come to an end
Instead of moving forward she rather pretend
Because like a tattoo artist
I get under her skin
So she hatin' on the kid
And its plain to see
I got her punchin' at the screen
Like she playin' the Wii
She only think about me when her cash is low
And she heard my name brought up by them classy hos
Cause she at the same nail shop where Cassie goes
And she up in the club with trash egos 
And it start to drive her nuts like pistachios
Cause I guess the g shocked her like a Casio
Then you shot yourself in the foot like Plaxico
And that's too much drama so you had to go</pre>
