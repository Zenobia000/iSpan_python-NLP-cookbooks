[Q-Tip Intro/Chorus]
I be that nigga that I think y'all know
With Mr. Busta Rhymes (A-yo, I'm in the studio)

[Busta Rhymes]
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know

[Q-Tip]
Close the door, 'ight, let a nigga rock
Cause we 'bout to eat real shit, not shit slop
Nigga can't say shit about this hip-hop
Cause I build dudes lanes while at pit stop
Built they styles and they names, Frankenstein, right
It's a high state game, dudes are playing it
I be questioning alot of y'all who made it in
Just move with the joint that we chartering
Make you disappear quick, like you're part of wind
Then laugh, ah-ha ha, and laugh again
Shorty, move a lil bit, I'm looking at your friend
Let's get in there and shake for the beat, girl
Do a lil eye wink, throw a tongue twirl
Gotta hit lock smashed in, tied down
We on your block, turned hot spots to ghost towns
A-yo, I'm tired of these niggaz, Bus-a-Bus, now
Say it to 'em

[Chorus - Q-Tip]
This is just, for the nasty
A-yo, this is just for the sassy
A-yo, this is just for the classy
A-yo, this is just for the what? (Tell 'em now)

[Busta Rhymes]
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know

[Busta Rhymes]
Pardon me, now, gimme room again
It's time to raise the level of the boom again
NOW WHO THAT?! Bus-a-bus-a-bus rhyme
(RAAAAAAA!!!) See, I ain't do that in a long time!
Spitting shit, make piece, do more crime
Hot songs, cribs, have a little more to shine
Alright, yea, shh shh, mm, uh, I pity y'all
The way I bang niggaz, and how I shit on y'all
Spit the slang bigger, make your label quit on y'all
And do my thang, bitch, from here to Synagogue
We getting alot of money, me and my friend, Kamal
I take your money too, I ain't afraid of y'all
With so much class, my shit will kill ya
When I don't wanna rap
And still I'ma smash and make the bitches Make It Clap
As soon as I'm finished with her, homey, I'll give her back
Say it to 'em

[Chorus - Q-Tip]
This is just, for the nasty
A-yo, this is just for the sassy
A-yo, this is just for the classy
A-yo, this is just for the what? (Tell 'em now)

[Busta Rhymes]
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know

[Q-Tip]
When the beat bang, and you're up in the club
When you listen and you feel a thug
When you hear my voice, understand the love
When the DJ spins it back, it's a friendly rub
But, when I'm behind, I cannot be kind
With your waistline, and the way you  move
Like a old great beat, I'ma catch a groove
Or like a old hip-hop joint, you Nice & Smooth (Come on, girl)

[Chorus - Q-Tip]
This is just, for the nasty
A-yo, this is just for the sassy
A-yo, this is just for the classy
A-yo, this is just for the what? (Tell 'em now)

[Busta Rhymes]
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know
Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know</pre>
