[Chorus]
Wait 
At the end of it all its you
And at the end of it all its you 
And at the end 
It's you 
At the end of it all its you 
It's you 
It's you 
At the end of it all its you 
It's you 
It's you 
At the end of it all 
 
[Verse 1]
Looking, for how I see her 
When I finally realized couldn't believe it 
I couldn't, even swallow 
Had a lump in my throat, my stomach hollow 
I had a notion that things were fishy 
But everything was fine so why be pissy 
But when you wasn't seeing me nights you get it in 
That's when the snooping and shit, it would begin 
Where you at? 
Where you going? 
That's what I get when I pick up the phone 
Not a hello or I miss you 
Or the renaissance, how does it do? 
Suspicious ones, go few 
Can stress out your brain 
It weighs on your man
And helps your peep game, I thought it was me 
But then I could see...
 
[Chorus]
It was you 
It's you 
At the end of it all it was you 
And at the end 
It was you 
At the end of it all it was you 
And at the end 
It's you 
It's you 
At the end of it all its you 
It's you 
It's you 
At the end of it all 
 
[Verse 2]
I couldn't take it 
But the spell of love 
I couldn't shake it 
Even though, I would discover 
That there was somebody else 
It was your lover 
You gave me up 
And managed to turn the tables 
And all your honest words they turn to fables 
The things that you would accuse me of 
It seem were the things you were doing love 
Get it? These things you projected 
And I don't want to be affected 
But when you get in love 
It's never easy love 
To make decisions of 
You've defected 
You were doing so much to try to pin me 
Going through all my stuff, but it was empty 
Answers, that I'm seeking 
Well it seem I'm getting close 
That I'm reaching 
And I was thinking, I had no reason 
Calling you a culprit, it was treason 
And the twinkle, in your eye 
It was kinda not for love 
And tell me why? 
We'll make amends if you admit it 
We can ascend if you're committed 
Your heart, is it in it? 
If it goes for many days 
Sweet love can decay from you 
 
[Chorus]
It's you 
At the end of it all it was you 
And at the end 
It was you 
At the end of it all it was you 
And the end 
It's you 
It's you 
At the end of it all its you 
It's you 
It's you 
At the end of it all</pre>
