The people at the label say they want something to repeat
But all my people really want something for the streets
So keep hooking
Hey ya'll what's goin on?
So keep hooking
It's time yo word is bond
So keep hooking
Let's do what we must do
So keep hooking
ah ah ah let's hear for
Keep keep
Who can make it up, dark ages here in rap
And the constant conversation has been let's bring it back
Corny rap style niggas they lack the pedigree
Deep waters they be in when they are just the manatee
Who me I am unaffected the Whale, the Hammerhead
The Magnanimous decision, unanimous, I am fed
What chu looking at, wait, I can help you with that
The Formidable, unforgettable painting Abstract
On the wall amongst them all from Tucson Michelle
A commodity, hot property, hears the morning bell
Guantanamo bayin niggas deferring routs
You soliloquies are trash inferring that you got clout
Homie, whats that about? You should revisit your scheme
Before the scheme it seems real it reverts back to a dream
Into that pea head of yours
You aint commanding no tours
You seeing fee per deim 
We seeing that in the doors
Plus a little bit more because she choosing the prettiest
Thou while its wittiest
On the low we the grittiest
Taking the task, these barbaric insurgents
Who nursery rhyme niggas and play like they are crime figures
Man, what could give you such a naive belief?
There's examples all around of careers being brief
The Luke Cage of the loose leaf page
Run and hide, comin out in the yard
Bonafied to be hard

So keep hooking
Keep hooking
Keep hooking
Keep hooking
Keep keep
So Keep hooking
Keep hooking
Keep hooking
Keep hooking
Keep keep
As if we reading pressures higher
We should all be that inspired
Too just lift it and take it higher
Peep the name that's on the flyer
The Midnight Marauder, low end theoretical
Ring tone rappers rockin shades are forgettable
Phantom of the rap world boo
Yo you puss in boots
Energy's electric who's looking for a love recruit
High definition for the fortunate you to view
Challenges with riches we will put you on strict review
Time to turn the tide around
Comin with the tribal sound
Brandishing these microphones, we outlaws in the town
Corruption in the fool pit, we witness the jam
Acquisition of materials the evil of man
Trickles down to MC's 
We combat the disease
With the good and hardy measurement
A real rap sediment
Degenerate genes and your bodies the host
You need to open up wide while we give you the douse

Gather round
Gather round
Gather round
It's the hottest thing
Gather round
Gather round
Gather round
It's the hottest thing</pre>
