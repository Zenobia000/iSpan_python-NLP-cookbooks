Artist: Q-Tip
Album:  The Renaissance
Song:   We Fight/We Love
Typed by: brad_oz@hotmail.com

[Verse 1]
And it, and it begins, he walks outside for a cigarette break
And thinks how many cigarettes does it take
He takes a long drag with the sun in his eye
He squints, he thinks he starts to sigh
Sometimes he cry
When he think about his girlfriend on his side
She held him down, she made him better
Fought the love, through the fucked up weather
And she thinkin about her life
With no more work just being a wife
But instead her love, she gave it to a man
Who fought against her lovely plans
So when she go to work, plus go to school
Plus fight the love, she must feel like a fool
She want the ease that come after pain
She fights for love, thats her campaign
We fight, we love

Chorus: Raphael Saadiq
We fight and love so much sometimes
I get confused of who we are
Maybe if we just stop and chat and
It will find out who we are
[2x]

(Fight) just a little bit
(Love) just a little bit
(Fight) just a little bit
(Love) just a little bit more

We just keep on...

(Fight) just a little bit
(Love) just a little bit
(Fight) just a little bit
(Love) just a little bit more
[2x]

[Verse 2]
And it, and it begins, he's off the ball
He left his friends, he ain't home no more
He's in a place, that's far away
Where he can't understand what they say
They say salaam, they cary bombs
In crouded places, and cause alarm
You're the infidel who's uninvited
But really an American boy who's slighted
It ain't your fault, you want identity
So you join this big fraternity
You get to travel the world, its cheaper than college
And you get guns and you get knowledge
Lookin for your soul, and WMD's
You can't find nothing, cause its empty
You got your gun, and he's your friend
And he's your man, until the end
We fight, we love

Chorus: Raphael Saadiq
We fight and love so much sometimes
I get confused of who we are
Maybe if we just stop and chat and
It will find out who we are
[2x]

(Fight) just a little bit
(Love) just a little bit
(Fight) just a little bit
(Love) just a little bit more

We just keep on...

(Fight) just a little bit
(Love) just a little bit
(Fight) just a little bit
(Love) just a little bit more
