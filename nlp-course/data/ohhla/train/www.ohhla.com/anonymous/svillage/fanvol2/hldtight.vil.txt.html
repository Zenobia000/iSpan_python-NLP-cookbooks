Album:  Fantastic Vol. 2
Song:   Hold Tight
Typed by: umishareefali@gmail.com

[Q-Tip]
Uhh, Hold tight this is the last time you hear me
I'm out now this is the last time you cheer me
Niggas said the game is gettin too slimey
Liable to make this ps brother turn grimey
Imma leave it in the hands of the slum now
Take it away from where it comes from now
Alot of you cats in the music business
Shiftless,  i'll put you on the shit list
Did ya intuition say the shit on me?
Imma just flip your ears yo you hear me b?
D'angelo play your piano
Jay Dee flip another beat for me
Hold tight with baatin and my nigga T3
Bus a buss watch out for who you trust
Ali Shaheed its your blood that I bleed
Yes phife for you I will give my life
Its the ummah shit fo real till theres no more light
All you foul motherfuckers change your wrong to right
Make sure y'all bring your music to the area flight Hold tight

[Chorus]
Hold tight ha ha ha ha ha ha
Hold tight Abstract what ya did yo
Hold tight SV what ya did yo
Hold tight

[Jaydee]
You don't pay attention man
Thats why your money is the size of your attention span
Yo theres something I gotta mention Damn
Who the fuck is this sittin in my session man?
This is my project hoe
Not some MC sham
Not yours watch your attention span
You probably bootleging my tape at a concession stand
What the fuck niggas never learn their lesson man
I try my best not to hold this smith and wesson man
But I gotta hold something cause niggas test you man
Anyway yo keep it movin keep the questions and
Maybe I can bless you with the test pressers man
Until then hold tight hold tight hold tight hold tight hold tight

[T-3]
Guess whos making this cheese this cash these bucks
So much cash in my hand that I got papercuts
Im tryna become a winner tryna get with us
Thats one of the reasons I had to fuck you up
I caught you peeping in my window tryna see what I'm doing
So I pulled out the 45 and commence to start shootin, see ya!
See I miss you wit every bullet cause you were keeping it moving
Now thats shhh unusual ...watch what you doing

So hold tight x8

[Baatin]
You dont understand
I been doing this shit since Duran Duran
Now imma some ol get the cash
My man I'm outta this
Cause you dont appreciate
I step up in the place tryna culptivate
You sippin on your tanqueray watch me levitate
you aint got no reason to celebrate
You caught up in my trap, sealing your fate
Never was it once you co operate
Which lead you to self destruct inside you hate
I hope you feelin better now
Hold tight to my rhyme
Nigga dont cry
Its alright you can move at your own pace
All together now

Hold tight x4</pre>
