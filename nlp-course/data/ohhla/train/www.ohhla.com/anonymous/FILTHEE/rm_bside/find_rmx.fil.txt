"You know"
"You know"
"You know"
"You know where to find us"
"You know"
"You know"
"You know"
"You know where to find us"

Chorus: F.I.L.T.H.E.E.
You can find us
Where the busters don't come
And the cops don't come
For your 911
And you can find us
Where we always been
Twenty deep in tenements
F.I.L.T.H.E.E. Immigrants

(Verse 1)
[B-Real]  You can find us blowin' trees in the west coast
          With the hottest birds, you know who's puffin' kush the most
          And if you find me, I got Stoned Assasins behind me
          You test us, causin' your death, comes untimely
          You press us, homey, you minding your damn senses
          It's senseless, you don't want trouble, you're defenseless
          Look homey, don't act ignorant
          Cause you get your cap peeled from this filthy ass immigrant
[Filthee] You can find us, in the game, playing for keeps
          Remix, leak, next week, hot in the streets
          B-Real, Guru, F.I.L.T.H.E.E., my Dilated peeps
          The track is so murder, you lyin' under the sheets
[Dutch]   You can find us on the backstreet, runnin' this track meet
          It's, business as usual, we killin' this phat beat
          I manifest rhymes that are made for marathons
          So when this {*shit*} goes down, yo, we ready to get it on

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
[Rakaa Iriscience]
You can find us in rallies sayin' "No" to Bush
And for the rights in Dr. Greenthumb to grow the kush
Catch Rakaa holdin' heat, like the Statue of Liberty
Visibly, shinin' light to bring in heavy artilery
We show them how the mics and turn tables are instruments
Ladies showin' skin and attempt to get intimate
Dilated rigger, we're gifted, unlimited
America's afraid, this filthy young immigrant

[Evidence]
You can find me without headlights, follow the president
Of Capitol Record's home, it helps to know which residence
Back at the lab, chop kicks and hats
You could find in the trash, throwin' out promotional wax
Or find me in the mix of action
Or at home in the crates, puffin' lye, relaxin'
Anyway, we should still neighborhood watch
With Filthee, Dutch and Rif, posted up on the block

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Guru]    You can find me, extraordinarily focus
          I don't miss, so you can merely quote this
          The G-U-R-U, I rep the hood off top
          While other rappers fell off, my name's good on the block
          BK's where I learned my trade (Trade...)
          Amongst the grimiest hustlers, I earned my grade
          Might mingle with the rich and famous
          Stay on point, though, in case we gotta get the flamers
[Filthee] You can find us planetary stars aligned
          Along come the streets, and the stars combine
          To find behind the ground, finds that shine like a stone
          We some brothers from the earth, with a caramel tone
[Dutch]   Hey, you can find us, payin' dues, shows are sold out
          Mosh pit, universal soldiers rolled out
          Fists in the air, that means the movement's begun
          For the people, by the people, so we feelin' it, son

Repeat Chorus
