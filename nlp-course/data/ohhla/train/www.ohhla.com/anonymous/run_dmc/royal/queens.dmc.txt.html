Artist: Run-D.M.C. f/ Nas, Prodigy 
Album:  Crown Royal 
Song:   Queens Day 
Typed by: Khadafi662@aol.com 

(Nas talking) 
We're the kings of rock now nigga, know-mean? 

(Chorus-mixing) 
Queens Day, cash made on Hollis Ave 
Q-B-O-R-O, nigga, makin niggas seem easy 
Queens Day, cash made on Hollis Ave 
Q-B-O-R-O, nigga, makin niggas seem easy 

(Nas) 
Yo
From the days of arm call niggas hung around blocks and corner stores 
Herringbone chains and fantasies rushin the door 
Niggas from Rastel poppin shells, snatchin rings 
Fly from shirt kings, from Queensbridge to 118 
I had my eyes open, steppin out into the world 
So fiendish, Ol' English 'til I url, growing pains 
A young kid, learnin early how to know the game 
USA Roller Skate rink, mobs and crews would take minks 
Clean streets, hustlers, crack cocaine 
Gave back by throwin block parties and basketball games 
A lotta cash made on Hollis Ave., fast and change 
High rollers was livin, until the Task Force came 
A lotta ghost towns and memories, bad blooded enemies 
So many died with the same gangsta pride that entered me 
Peace to them old timers, they who taught us 
How to stand strong and pass it on to the sons and daughters 
We all glow, and I'm proud to be all that I know 
Q-B-O-R-O, nigga, who I die for 
Survi-val, how we came a long way in solidarity 
Don't let nothin try an spoil this day 
To Run, D and Jay it's love and my thug salute 
'Cause real love's the only thing that comes above this loot 
Carhart jeans, it makes me think of LL's troops 
Let's celebrate, it's Queens Day, this one's for you 

(Chorus) 2x 

(Run) 
Some come out they hometown and they never get dealt 
But three teens from Queens took over the world and never let go 
Just regular cats you know that just happened to blow 
Not anonymous with Hollis, Jake, Darrell and Joe 
Ay yo, we made so that others could grow 
Look at LL, A Tribe Called Quest, Mobb and Nas Esco 
Ain't takin credit, we showin pride, look at us now 
Got haters mouths all open wide, wonderin how 
In some cases the only thing that father and son 
Have in common is they love for Run 
Been the illest since day one, I'm too advanced to ever be caught 
Who's more legendary than me...that's what I thought 
And if somebody wanna test mine, yo, watch this 
Peter Piper picked peppers...... 
And see I knew you knew the next line, and I bet you said it 
It's been a minute, I'm still the king of the world so don't forget it 

(Chorus) 2x 

(Prodigy) 
This is for my Q dogs who lit the block like spark 
We grew up on Old English 
Summertime Broyal Wilders Park used to be the shit, 
why'd it have to stop 
On the Ave. niggas blew on all the jewelry spots 
Kicked the shirt kings for an ill airbrush top 
That'll match my cortez Nike's 
Niggas gettin robbed at the back door comin out with bags 
We used to get our gold fronts, from Eddie's gold caps 
What y'all know about that 
I bet the whole Queens do, around '86 with the chrome bass crew 
The young guns and lost boys made the news
Queensbridge is story in two 
The story is true 
So let's party for the borough and shit 
And everybody come outside, 'cause it's Queens Day kid 

(Chorus) 3x </pre>
