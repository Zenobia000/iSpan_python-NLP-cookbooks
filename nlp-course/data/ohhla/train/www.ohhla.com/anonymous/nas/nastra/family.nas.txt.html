Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Havoc]
Yo..

Dunn you fam to me, and only family
that can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Blowin green that's keepin us goin
Allah Havoc gettin right, on them 747

Dunn you fam to me, and only family
that can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Blowin green that's keepin us goin
Unconditional love showin

Yo, yo, yo, yo
40th Side, 41st Side, ride

[Prodigy]
Me and my Dunns come from the slums
You can't take the slums out my Dunns 
and that's how it is, that's how we live
Sometimes I find myself wearin the same shit for days
not carin, bout what they gon' think or say
I got that, "I don't give a fuck" in me, it's stuck in me
That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggaz, y'all too pretty
We too gritty, like Sanford and Son (what)
Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on
See we the top rap niggaz, the Q-Dogs
You got a lot of nerve, puttin out them songs
knowin that my niggaz come strong, so let's get it on
We just gettin warm, Operation "Quiet Storm"
Silent wars or we silence the fours
Hav, P, and Nas, got it in the smash, fo'sho
Now it's movies and soundtracks
This is where your career stop at

[Nas]
Aiyyo I drink to that
I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me
You violate? They read your obituary, in front your family
You should idolize Nas in the flesh
Don't wait til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt
We shot hoops with coathangers, got loot with dopeslangers
Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger
Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit
Bought weight from rosters, travel hot routes
O.T. commute back and forth
Tell shorty get that package off
Fuck bein trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit
Caught a case then I beat the shit
D's on the block flash badges, nylon jackets
Big white boys with guns yellin, "Freeze black kids!"
Got my niggaz in the pen, eatin octopus
Wishin they was on the blocks with us
to watch me and P do it (uh) put the heat to it (uh)
Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it
Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music
and think deep to it, now who the truest?

[Mobb Deep]
Yo..

Dunn you fam to me, and only family
that can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Blowin green that's keepin us goin
Allah Havoc gettin right, on them 747

Dunn you fam to me, and only family
that can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Blowin green that's keepin us goin
Unconditional love showin

Yo you fam to me, and only family
that can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Blowin green that's keepin us goin
Unconditional love showin

Are you fam to me, and only fam to me
that can get that close to me
Keep it type strong

[Prodigy]
Dirty fingernails, reachin in my pocket pullin knots out
I daydream of better days, in different ways
out this lifestyle we live, iced out with the big fifth
That's why the burnt leather lean to the left
Even though we gained cash on fish
I'm trapped on reason bein we ain't all rich
And I'ma be that same nigga for the door
And I'ma still walk the same path, we soon clash
We get stacks, you do the math
We pound niggaz out, walk away and laugh
Fresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus kid
Rap niggaz shit they drawers

[Nas]
Yo they probably did
I aircondition y'all niggaz, my prediction is you rewind this
Your highness, Q-Boro's finest
Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas
Grant you a wish, you get rich while listenin hard
To my thugs in the prisonyard, bench-pressin 200 pounds and up
Feelin like you down on your luck
Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library
Appeal the game, all eyes on me
Restrained from, bein looked at, it's uncivilized
We epitomize thug song, y'all niggaz get mad
Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style
no heart and no look, shook
Get stole on, my niggaz move right in the moonlight
Y'all niggaz get done, I pee on them son, they a small issue
We too official, blue steel pistols
Teflon vests, it's no contest we hit you

[Mobb Deep]
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
that can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Blowin green that's keepin us goin
Unconditional love showin

Yo, yo, yo, yo
Forty decide, Forty-First side right

Yeah youknahmsayin?  Not for nuttin baby
Knahmsayin wanna give a shout out to my peoples
YouknowhatImean?  Yambo, Ill Will
Killa Black, my brother
It's never gonna be another
Word up..

Yeah, you know how we do things</pre>
