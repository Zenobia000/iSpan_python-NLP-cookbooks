      And niggaz is stealin, your whole techniques and shit
      Niggaz wanna take everything from a nigga man
[Dre] Yeah yeah yo Nas it's like this man
      ("Nas is coming..")
      Niggaz can't do it like I do it, d'yaknahmsayin?
      Just like niggaz can't do what you do
      ("Nas is coming..")
[Nas] Right, right
[Dre] You know, can't nobody fuck with this
      ("Nas is coming..")
      You know all these niggaz out here just..
      ("Nas is coming..")
      talkin this East coast West coast bullshit
      Niggaz need to kill that shit
      ("Nas is coming..")
      and make some money, y'know?
[Nas] WORD!

[Dre] Fuck it

      ("Nas is coming..")
      All these niggaz talkin all this bullshit
      ("Nas is coming..")
      better sit back, and watch what happens
      ("Nas is coming..")

[Nas]
The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holdin out
Let the streets be the court - and corners hold the trial
Fatal not fictitious
I rock the cable 86 shit, foreign cars young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Solicitin, ill editions of that Murder I WRote
A provocative plan, can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on top of the sand
In the heat of the moment, like Farrakhan said, we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes, chrome kitted up
Calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched checking my nuts, I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutchin gats quick to bust
But knowin how these niggaz tattle
I sneak move get the drop, one shot, without the gun battle
So when you run the lead travel
I come through it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you

[Chorus - unknown singers]
Nas is comin, Nas is comin
Nas is comin.. (Nasty Nas is comin) Nas is comin
Nas is comin, Nas is comin
Nas is comin.. (Nasty Nas is comin) Nas is comin

[Nas]
In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window
I spot the fake, red dot his face, like a Hindu
Snatched the symbol, tied his hands too
Make examples, substantial amounts you owe, to the fam
Crew, Firm affliation, paper chasin
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano
Sophisticado, Blazin hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
compared to these niggaz who swear to be real
but impostors to Hoffa, Nas plague kills
Countin bills to send to all my jail niggaz who fell
From New York to L.A., Q.B. to C.P.T. for G.P.
A hundred G cars, Garcia Vegas cigars
Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout, murder material serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's somethin venereal
but back in stereo

[Chorus]

[Nas]
From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface
I bit the fruit from the Serpent
Apocalyptic, get bent, stay splifted
Control the rap game you got it twisted
Dr. Dre way the 'Bridge say, shake dice and kiss it
Sip Crist', push the six with biscuit
Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen y'all, Nas y'all
Fly gangsta, wavy hair teeth chipped in
My shit bump, in the courtroom drunk, links truck
rocky bracelet, cognac kernel never chase it
Rap hero, black DeNiro
Federal Bureau, tapped my line and got zero
Rap pro, diamond roll, hustlin low -
pro-file, white gold style, rakin bloody dough by the pile
Shot down, still alive he strugglin for the phone
Fo'-fo' blow him, when homicide comes, these three words are sung

[Chorus] - 2X

[Dr. Dre]
Check this out
It's Nasty Nas, and Dr. Dre
Hahaha, East meets West
That's how we makin it happen
That's how it goes down for the nine-six
Aiyyo Nas let's get this money
Let's get paid
Sit back and watch all these motherfuckin clowns out here
riffin and beefin about this BULLSHIT
Yo, heh
While they doin all that
we just gon' kick back with these honies, this Cristal
Hah, and party to the year 2G

[Chorus]

[Dre - speaking over chorus]
Hehehe, that's right, that's right
Yeah, Nasty Nas, Dr. Dre
Makin it happen</pre>
