Artist: Nas f/ Lauryn Hill
Album:  It Was Written
Song:   If I Ruled the World
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro: Nas] + (Lauryn Hill singing in the background)
Life..... I wonder....
Will it take me under.... I don't know

[Verse One: Nas]
Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue behind my waters
No welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot my son got not evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate knowledge
of coke was cooked without the garbage we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin, fashion
Designer clothes, lacing your click up with diamond vogues
Your people holdin dough, no parole
No rubbers, go in raw imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine"

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas]
If I ruled the world                            Imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls                       Could it be, if you could 
                                                be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world                            Still livin for today, in
                                                these last days and times

[Verse Two: Nas]
The way to be, paradise like relaxin black, latino and anglo-saxon
Armani exchange the reins
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, click rollin
Trickin six digits on kicks and still holdin
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisonner set free, stress free 
No work release purple M3's and jet skis 
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities and reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul but every girl I meet to go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica send em to Africa

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas]
If I ruled the world                            Imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls                       Could it be, if you could 
                                                be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world                            Still livin for today, in
                                                these last days and times

And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

[Verse Three: Nas]
You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin from Jake, gettin chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate we carry weight
Tryin to get laced, flip the ace stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Makin moves in Atlanta, back and forth scrambler
Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga havin shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck???

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas]
If I ruled the world                            Imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love em em baby
Black diamonds and pearls                       Could it be, if you could 
                                                be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world                            Still livin for today, in
                                                these last days and times

If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled    Imagine that
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black dimaonds       Could it be, if you could
black diamonds                                  be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world                            Still livin for today, in
                                                these last days and times

If I ruled the world, if I ruled
if I ruled, I'd free all my sons
black diamonds, I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled
If I ruled the world

If I ruled the world
I love em love em baby!!</pre>
