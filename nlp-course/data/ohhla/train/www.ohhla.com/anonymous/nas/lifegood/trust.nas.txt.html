[Intro: Nas]
It's like a cold story.. 
repeated over and over..
and the winter's on my mind
Yea, this shit be real man..
Shit's crazy out here..
Yo-yo! Yo waddup y'all!
That's my niggaz over there, word
 
[Nas]
If you scared to take chances, you'll never have the answers
I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is
Wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is
Is he gon' cock it and pop it? His waistband big
But he don't have that thing in 'em, slangin just ain't in 'em
Body language is off, he's soft
But soft niggaz all a sudden start dumpin, frontin
Cause he feel a way, my niggaz say the eyes is a giveaway
One look could tell me if you really came to kill me
Be the quiet nigga lookin, layin with the milli
Who that over there creepin? Who homie by the tree?
Better safe than sorry, look at p-noid me
Few machine guns close, we could squeeze all three
Be a cold day in hell 'fore they creep on me
It's a lesson every premonition
Lotta niggaz killed cause they wasn't paying attention
Listen
 
[Chorus: Nas]
I want a bitch I can trust, some niggaz I can trust
Accountants lookin over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
A Ruger I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that, know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggaz true colors becomin clear more
 
[Nas]
It's been so long, can't remember how we begun this war
This is a ever-lasting thunderstorm
Cause guns went off, I see your moms she still speak
She don't know, I ain't cool with her son no more
It's old shit, seem forever we holdin this grudge
Takes REAL men to squash beef, end it with hugs
We buried our dead, been years, why should I worry 'bout him?
Constantly watchin my back, plus niggaz tellin I dread
another day I put a family in black, though I be calm and relaxed
Though I know somehow it will come back
Even if I'm in the right, cause still a life is a life
What was it worth, to see you covered in dirt? 
It's quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted
Mother's cry, no statute of limitation 
on a homicide, just tattoos of my niggaz names 
I wonder will it change, let's ride
 
[Chorus]
 
[Nas]
It's rare I listen to niggaz who never been in my position
A caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers
Sit down lil' man, let me school you with hood business
Seen a lotta niggaz blow, lotta dreams folded
Some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated
Ain't too much left to buy, bought it 
I’m loaded I guess, lear jets
I ask myself, do I need love or success?
They say the artist that truly suffers, his stuff is the best
Cause his heart, bleed on his sleeve pain pistols and sex
Remember spray paintin the word "fresh" and then starin at it
Older folks angry, pointin, swearin at it
Buildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the McLaren past it
Same old man from years ago told me life is short
So from infant to geriatric, trust your own judgment
Live with it and love it
 
[Chorus]</pre>
