Album:  Life Is Good
Song:   Bye Baby
Typed by: Gemini_20502K@Yahoo.com

[Intro: Sample from "Goodbye Love" by Guy]
I guess you knew and blew a good thing! Baby!

[Verse One: Nas] (Sample from "Goodbye Love" by Guy)
Bye baby I guess you know why I walked away
When we walked to the altar that was an awesome day
Did counselin, couldn't force me to stay
Somethin happened when you say I do, we go a stray
Why did we mess it up we was friends we had it all
Reasons you don't trust men that was your daddy fault
He in the grave let it go he no longer livin
Said you caught him cheatin with mom fuckin other women
Fuck that gotta do with us here's the keys to the newest truck
Bergen bags, we burnin cash now baby do it up
Now matter who you fucked, that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since saw you screamin "Hate you so much right now!!!"
Should have saw the meanin angry black women, actions of a demon, I'm leavin
(I guess you knew and blew a good thing! Baby!)

[Chorus: Nas] (Sample from "Goodbye Love" by Guy)
Bye baby! (You know I'm sayin bye bye!)
Bye bye baby! ('Cause I'm sayin bye bye!)
Bye baby! ('Cause I'm sayin bye bye!)
(I guess you knew and blew a good thing! Baby!)

[Verse Two: Nas] (Sample from "Goodbye Love" by Guy)
Bye baby I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy 'bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam I'm thinkin you cats were weird
Same time different year, I was diggin y'all flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us, matchin gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janice Joplin
Yet, the cuter version, yet, I knew your personally better than you knew yourself
And I know this for certain
Cribin in Dominican you got away from everybody 
You screamin at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life like ha yo look at my wife!
Gangsta! Me and twenty cops 'bout to fight
Crazy night, judge rout, next mornin we got clean
Like it never happened and later we at the Heat game
Just another day in the life, of two people in love
(*UH!) But it wasn't enough (*UH!) But baby guess what
(I guess you knew and blew a good thing! Baby!)

[Chorus: Nas] (Sample from "Goodbye Love" by Guy)
Bye baby! (OH! OH! AHHHHHHH!H Bye bye!)
Bye bye baby! (I can't believe that this is happenin to us! 'Cause I'm sayin bye bye!)
Bye baby! ('Cause I'm sayin bye bye!)
(I guess you knew and blew a good thing! Baby!)

[Verse Three: Nas]
Listen! Could you imagine writin your deposition?
Divorce lawyer tellin you how this thing 'gon be endin
With you payin out the ass, and I'm talkin half
Not some but half, no, serious half!
Half of your soul half of your heart you leavin behind
It's either that or die, I wanted peace in mind
And all I seen was suckers, cowards!
Under their breath sayin why did Nas trust her? But look at yourself speak louder bruh!
You live with your baby mom's and scared to make a honest woman out of her
And make her your bridge fake pimps you ain't even a lie
At least I could say I tried plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy my little joy and pride
He got my nose my grill your color your eyes
Next go 'round I hope I pick the truest type
And watch me do it all again it's a beautiful life
Aight! Goodbye!

[Chorus: Nas] (Sample from "Goodbye Love" by Guy)
Bye baby! (You know I'm sayin bye bye!)
Bye bye baby! (I can't believe that this is happenin to us! 'Cause I'm sayin bye bye!)
Bye baby! (I guess you knew and blew a good thing! You know I'm sayin bye bye!)
(I guess you knew and blew a good thing! Baby!)</pre>
