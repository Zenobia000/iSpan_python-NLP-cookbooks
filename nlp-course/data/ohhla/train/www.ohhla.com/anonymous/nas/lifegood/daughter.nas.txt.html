Album:  Life Is Good
Song:   Daughters

[Intro]
Check it out
I call it..
Yeah, yeah..
I call it -- shit for niggaz with daughters
I call this -- shit for niggaz with daughters
I call this -- shit for niggaz with daughters
I call this -- shit for niggaz with daughters

[Nas]
I saw my daughter send a letter to a boy her age who locked up
First I regret it, then I caught my rage like
"How could I not protect her from this awful phase?"
Never try to hide who I was, she was taught and raised like
a princess, but while I'm on stage, I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she seen me switchin women, pops is on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin
So if her husband is a gangsta, can't be mad, I'll love him - never!
For her, I want better, homie in jail, dead that
Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggaz got game, they be tryin ta live
He seen ya mama crib, plus I'm SURE he know who your father is
Although you real, PLUS an honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen, I got a problem with it
She look at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure
but she rockin with it

[Chorus]
This for niggaz with daughters
I call this -- shit for niggaz with daughters
Yo, not sayin that our sons are less important...
Shit for niggaz with daughters
I call this -- shit for niggaz with daughters
I call it.. not sayin that our sons are less important...

[Nas]
This morning I got a call nearly split my wig
The social network said, "Nas, go and get ya kid"
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon' post no pic
of herself underdressed, no inappropriate shit, right?
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what's got inside this child's mind
She planted, a box of condoms on the dresser then she Instagrammed it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Shoulda drove on time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
to public school, they too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's your little princess
Next day, she's talkin boy business, what is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heartbreakers in the world
God gets us back, He make us have precious little girls 
Uh~!

[Chorus]

[Outro: Nas]
And I ain't tryna mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man, nah 
The way mothers feel for they sons how fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off
'cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters
Love</pre>
