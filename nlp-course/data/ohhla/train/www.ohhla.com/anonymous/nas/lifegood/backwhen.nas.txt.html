Artist: Nas 
Album:  Life Is Good
Song:   Back When
Typed by: Gemini_20502K@Yahoo.com

[Intro: Sample from "Raptivity" by Ronnie Gee]
Warning-Warning-Warning-Warning
New York-New York-New York-New York
The sound-The sound-The sound
You about to hear-to hear-to hear-to hear-to hear-to hear-to hear

[Chorus: Sample from "The Bridge" by MC Shan] (Nas)
(*Sample from "Live Routine" by MC Shan)
You love to hear the story how it all
how it all got started-got started (Start it off!!!)
You love to hear the story how it all
how it all got started-got started (*Ah Yeah!!!)
You love to hear the story how it all got started
got started (Start it off!!! Start it off!!!)
Back when-Back when-Back when-Back when-Back when (Yeah!)
Back when-Back when-Back when-Back when-Back when (Yeah!)

[Verse One: Nas]
The ill reminisce and think about the fly days
Nothin like them '80 summer N.Y. days
Hop on the NB5 days
Mo' peds, Pro-Keds, city split five ways
How it all started, 5th floor apartment
A jigsaw puzzle arial view of the projects
A kid source trouble bury a view of his partners
Now I chill in resorts, enjoyin the sights
Check out the oracle bread from city housing
Nas! I arise the dead by thousands
I remember seein Shan, chillin near his Audi 
Hollis had Run and 'em 
But I probably put a poster up of Shan and Marley, that was art kid
You love to hear the story how it started 
The brotherly I'm poor I wasn't popped yet
Before their was an audience to watch as I assure you, there was a process

[Chorus: Sample from "The Bridge" by MC Shan] (Nas)
(*Sample from "Live Routine" by MC Shan)
You love to hear the story how it all
how it all got started-got started (How it all got started! Yeah!)
You love to hear the story how it all
how it all got started-got started
(How it! How it! How it all got started!) (*Ah Yeah!!!)
You love to hear the story how it all got started
got started (Hear the story! How it all! How it all got started!)
Back when-Back when-Back when-Back when-Back when (Back when!)
Back when-Back when-Back when-Back when-Back when (Back when!)

[Verse Two: Nas]
To call them fake today it's hate, real niggas extinct
'Pac left me inside a rap world with niggas that wink
At other rappers undercover niggas spit every way
Won't be surprised if all their lives have federal plates
Let alone their wardrobes is Studio Four flow
It was real when I appeared it would have been some jaws broke
Nas! My real name stage name same thing
How could youlet these lames claim king? I'm so ashamed mayne!
I light a L for Vernon, for niggas who would burn in hell for Vernon
10th Street, 12th Street, Nightmare on Elm Street
Pimps creep, delve deep, inside the editorials 
Of the ghetto queens kings stories true
Who possesses the testicular fortitude 
To blow away mist, that's a endurance to all of you
You blame your own short comings on sex and race
The mafia, homosexuals and all the jews
It's hogwash point of views, stereotypical
Anti-semetic like the foul words Gibson spewed
And it's patethic, I don't get the credit I deserve that's why I hate doin interviews
But I don't sweat it study long study wrong
My man Deion said Nas overthink the songs he writin
I'm not a wack performer standin there with corny hype men
I got the donism in me I'm here to enlighten

[Chorus: Sample from "The Bridge" by MC Shan] (Nas)
(*Sample from "Live Routine" by MC Shan)
You love to hear the story how it all
how it all got started-got started (How it all got started! Yeah!)
You love to hear the story how it all
how it all got started-got started
(How it! How it! How it all got started!) (*Ah Yeah!!!)
You love to hear the story how it all got started
got started (Hear the story! How it all! How it all got started!)
Back when-Back when-Back when-Back when-Back when (Back when!)
Back when-Back when-Back when-Back when-Back when (Back when! Back when!)</pre>
