Artist: Nas f/ Nikki Flores
Album:  Life Is Good
Song:   Roses
Typed by: Gundress03@yahoo.com

[Chorus: Nikki Flores]
Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn in my hide
I should've known, we can't repair what we broke
But I held you close
Too close I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't want them no more
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't need them no more

[Verse One: Nas]
I have no time to give you guidance 
Barely have any fuck time either 
Hefner minded like, I think you're fine, but 
I seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver 
Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her 
Or if she insecure, most are 
If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off 
Not a judge cause a judge dont wear no draws, yet he allows 
Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows 
My tax bracket not enough blacks have it 
Who should I date? Project chick or Cuban actress? 
A white chick, they might flip talking that blackness 
Should only attract black shit, I'm an ass magnet 
If you mad at that, you'll be mad forever 
Never played you, I prayed we would stay together 
Wished it'd last forever, know what I mean 
Heard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams 

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Nas]
Them Xanax can't manage your maniac manic depressive expressions 
They some silent killers, that stress shit 
That put ulcers in a lot of niggas 
I'm blowing medical, it helps chill a violent temper 
I done went to hell and back, you always think you right 
You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight 
When people like my song, you want to kill'em right? 
You resent me every time I make a million right? 
You want to experience life when you calling all the shots 
Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot 
Have your own cash, own your own Benz 
Your own house, everything, me, I understand 
Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee 
Put you on under Martin Scorsese: Mean Street 
The first movie he made, thought that was fly 
I thought you was flyer, you a fuckin' liar 

[Chorus]</pre>
