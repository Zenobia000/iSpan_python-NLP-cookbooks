Artist: Nas f/ Victoria Monet
Album:  Life Is Good
Song:   You Wouldn't Understand
Typed by: Gemini_20502K@Yahoo.com

[Intro: Nas]
Yeah! Harlem! Bronx! Brooklyn!

[Verse One: Nas]
Let's make a bet I know the reason you ain't make it yet
You say you set but you ain't see the tedious ingredients 
That go inside of a rider you hidin for problems 
And, you never knew how to make dollars
You couldn't make orders at a drive through McDonald's
I was fly at the Apollo with Black Jason '89 with a bottle
Niggas jealous of Jason dark green seven forty no tint
Rollie on wrist gleamin he rocked the baldy
Used to ride with him to Brooklyn, Louis and Halsey
Copped chocolate tie, burnin style and burn it down
My nigga hype in the federal joint verdict out
20 years gettin money in the dirty south
That's alleged, you see my nigga a stand up dude
So I'm yellin free my nigga
My nephew godfather Malik, he jammed up too
For what his hands usually call for but he ain't do it

[Chorus: Victoria Monet]
Who you are, ain't in the recipe of what I am
'Cause where I'm from, and what I see you wouldn't understand
Where I been, and what I do, no matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from, and what I see you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

[Verse Two: Nas]
You ever been on the other end of a robber's revolver?
Not me, call me lucky Nas Casalana
All but shot in the medulla oblongata
And survived to praise God, with a bullet I never collided
Some did and they lived, I salute the guys
My west spillin splash my mistake on my 10 booth for ya
N.Y. nigga, Adidas
Joggin suit, shell toe, slim fly nigga
Hudson river, rent a boat, t shirt with a dinner coat
A Venice villa like I'm the ghost of Demetrio
On any day getting throwed in a tinted vehicle
Like a old B.K. gangsta but I'm the C.E.O. 
Of Nasty Minds Enterprises, master mind made men
My success symbolizes loyalty, great friends
Dedication hard work, routine builds character
In a world full of snakes, rats and scavengers
Never make choices out of desperation
I think through it, break through walls like Pink Floyd
And drink fluids of all kind of alcohol y'all
Vineyards in France, yachts out in Cannes

[Chorus: Victoria Monet]
Who you are, ain't in the recipe of what I am
'Cause where I'm from, and what I see you wouldn't understand
Where I been, and what I do, no matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from, and what I see you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

[Verse Three: Nas]
Now holla at a millionaire
Rollie he blow an audemar, decided which one to wear
Who to screw, what to drive, 550 with the creamed guts inside
Or the super sport range truck that's fly
Diamond ring on my knuckles, like fire bitch
Gats on the side I don't really trust this guy
Spent a couple bucks tonight on bottles on cuties, if she beautiful
The lustful type,  I hit it and bust inside
Fuck it I'm a die one day, they 'gon probably make that day a holiday
Until then, let's go on a shoppin spree
Speakin for my real niggas, only OG'S
Certified, who kill niggas, when put in that seat, but tonight we on chill nigga
Chill mode, spill mo' spades
Listen to Jeezy and Hov, some Rozay
It's like we always on the grind, with no brakes
So tonight we 'gon act like we on vacation, with this on rotation

[Chorus: Victoria Monet]
Who you are, ain't in the recipe of what I am
'Cause where I'm from, and what I see you wouldn't understand
Where I been, and what I do, no matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from, and what I see you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

[Outro: Nas]
Uh! For my hood niggas, yeah, yeah
To my man Eric B, whattup?
Yeah! The whole city, I see you
To my man Big Slate, in the fed joint, my man Spark
Free my niggas, all my niggas, yeah!
Club Vernon, I see you, I see you!
Yeah! The Balton, I see you!</pre>
