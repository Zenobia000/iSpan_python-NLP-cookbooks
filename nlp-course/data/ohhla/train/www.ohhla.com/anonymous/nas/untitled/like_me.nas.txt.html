[Intro]
Ay yeah, what's happenin mommy? How you doin baby?
Oh you lookin kinda good and everything, I see you with them stilettos on baby
Ay check this out, you ain't got time to talk to me?
Ay let me put the bug in your ear baby
Want you turnin them hoe shoes into some flows shoes, you dig?
Yeah, check this out, this Universe Finest, your Royal Highness
You know what baby? I can do a whole lot of thangs for you
Guess why, cause I'm a motherfuckin pimp

[Hook: singer]
(Like me...) Hustlin and grindin babe
(I be...) Stayin on that paper chase
In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you, you a nigga
(Like me...) Hustlin and grindin babe
(I be...) Stayin on that paper chase
In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you

[Verse 1]
The good man in me say "Get money and stay on the path"
But the pimp shit in me say "Yo, keep lookin for ass"
But my daughter gave me a gift, somethin to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snow
I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes
Better wait till you grown, when he love you, you'll know
Everybody's got a dream, a hopeful wish to own a six times two
Cylinder whip, a fantasy, a bone to pick
With friends to get against who I don't know
Someone who said you won't blow, you won't eat, you won't cake
They mistake blamin me for they failures, I'm fresh, gettin tailored
Single breasted, a lip brush, it's senseless, some pimp shit
A woman hates a man and stays with him for many years
Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him
Now lame is how the ghetto judge him, cause he still with her
She'll take his cash and give it to some other real nigga

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Ay pimpin been goin on man for eons and eons man since the beginnin of time
You know me, the only thing I need to do is get on the grind and get mine
So the only thing I gotta tell you man is you know, do what you gotta do man
Bring my money back, get on that track and get on your back

[Verse 2]
I heard 'em say the NBA's a bunch of million-dollar slaves
A portea wasn't real back in the days, the point I make is
Jerry owns the Lakers, his yearly takings
Let's just say more than collectively all of his players
That's business, not really pimp shit
Maybe a titbit similar to when we rappers make big hits
and not own the masters, that's the deal
By the way, portea helps all the Denzels excel
He kept it more than real, but Hollywood can turn a girl out
I knew a girl bout, 5'9", so fine, she could result grind
She was sleek, sheek, with a classic mouth
Movie directors always fucked her on the casting couch
She came out with a blockbuster, can't knock a hustler
She not a hooker, she focused, a hopeless soul on a lonely road
I showed her all my stones and gold
I said "Bitch, life is cold, you need to roll with a nigga"
