Blaze a 50, sit back in the drop top Azure Bentley
of course wit me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney
Brizilian candy, from Miami
massouse, wedding ring on, lovin Celine Dion
hate rap, told me where she get caked at
shes a part time danca, part time romanca
tries to be a mother when she gets a chance ta
left her husband, alone to raise they son hes in pampers
modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree
33 recoverin from plastic surgery
went from 34B to 36 double D
met her in San Diego at tha Super Bowl party
had the Heiny sipped it up, wit Terrell Davis
MVP, we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated
I was silked out, flossin wit stout, he had the gators
when she walked in, she lit up the room, like Las Vegas
Terrell said our mans a full back for the Raiders
a drunk whod fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers
its easy to get the pussy, just dont fall in love
next thing u know im hugged up wit this bitch in tha tub
Palm Springs, Al Capone's Sweate washin her feet
is this love? somebody's wife fuckin a thug
hittin it raw, tastin it, wildin out on my charactor, tapin it
Tyra Banks face is face lift, givin head like she knew me for years
pillow talk, she let out tears, told me bout her husbands affairs
millions, she would get, if his neck got slit
she rolled the equality, then passed the lye ta me
told me bout her mans life insurance policy
he stays on the golf course, wears Drakkar Sport
evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort
you can take a man here goes the keys you can slip in the rear
chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somwhere
so we can make more money, then you could ever see rappin
split the cash 'n, move to Venezuela, adaptin'
P-11's, A-C-P Shells for blastin
caught him wit his spanish maid, he had a liter wit a can of spray
burnin her legs, she tied to the bed
sex S and M, sadomasochistic
sadistic, yoked her from behind, blew him out exsistance
his maid cried no, lucky she was blind fold
naked wit, mad burn marks, all on her thighs yo
twelve point five million, he kept his funds in the loines of London
goes to his wife and his children
yo i thought, what if shorty gets scared, electric chairs all i vision
all she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision
I'll switch the plan, then maybe fly to Switzerland
fake ID, forge his wife name, catch the next flight the same night
headed to Spain, nice game, now its back to where we meet again..
( reverse scratch )
Blaze a 50
sit back in a droptop Bezour Bently
of course wit me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney
top down, nightmare, blow her hair
sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare
fast lane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash
took a blast, out of her coke bag
snorted it, started screamin yo we almost crashed!
earlier i took the coke out, replaced it wit crushed up glass
her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep
overwhelmed by greed, put to death</pre>
