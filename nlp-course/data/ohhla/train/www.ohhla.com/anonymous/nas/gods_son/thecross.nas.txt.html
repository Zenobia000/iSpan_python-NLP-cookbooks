Artist: Nas
Album:  God's Son
Song:   The Cross
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus 2X: Nas]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross

[Nas]
Y'all can keep y'all weak beats, from your corny producers
There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to
I was the old king of the streets, that y'all once hated
But now I reinvented myself, and y'all all waited
NAS, N.A.S. mean Niggaz Against Society
Noisy I aim not silently, noose all surroundin me
I hang 'em I string 'em up ain't no thing I just drop 'em
to which doctor you copped and you locked and it ain't what it was
I changed it up from that pop shit it's hard to see R&B
rappers arguably, started fuckin up the game horribly
Cause, I parted the sea, then these novices targetted me
Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin to me
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin to be
the next me, yeah I support him but he's blinded I see
jealousy he love me to death am I buggin I love him for life
We both still mournin on our mother's, life
And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck
A six, a truck, some guns to bust
I wish it was that simple, the last emperor, hit yo' ass
with the Nasty Nas, diary, get out my path

[Chorus]

[Nas]
I can't keep a bitch cause none of them come up for a little less
I can't be too rich, too many hoes, lined up for sex
I can't rest until my niggaz in houses with pretty maids
Water and flowers in 'em
While my niggaz walk around in they trousers grinnin
Gotta keep a lot of heat; 30 cals 10 millimeters
40 cals plus the heckler, to set y'all straight
You too light?  I shoot your freckles out
You too dark?  The infrared show you what the tec about
Huh?  I'm stressin out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks, who mad greedy
We can sell mo', boats on the coast
Give, coats to the po' and give, hope to the broke then live low
But that ain't reality, I look happy but under the sky
You see a nigga who know, out of three women 2 out of 3
will love you but lead you to they own, hidden evil
BITCH!  You the reason niggaz be beefin, hoe get on
'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on
From here on, it's a new day
Million dollars ain't, what it was yesterday
Many problems, many niggaz, most involved but they fake
Hope y'all relate

[Chorus]

[Nas] I carry the cross</pre>
