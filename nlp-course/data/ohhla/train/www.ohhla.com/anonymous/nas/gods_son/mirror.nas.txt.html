[Verse 1]
Yo, my man was regulatin on niggas he used to thug with
Older niggas in this murder game, drug czars
BM, Jaguars, they cash was large
Since he was wild, they let him in
He did a crazy number of things
To put himself deeper under they wing
It didn't take long for duke to get on
Studied they movements - who would kill, who was strong
Studied like a student, got it bloody, he was shootin
Drivin they cars, robbin connects
Drivin his Lex, keys was movin
Young don, now they know they weakness
They never seen it comin
Son was on some real take over the streets hit
Now he got his own crew of young guns clickin now
Richer now, now they run shit, see how it flips around?

[Verse 2]
Dudes be, comin from bids thinkin shit is different
Cause the streets move fast, you blink, you could miss it
I just sit back and, think of my last 20 years
6 pack, gunnin my years, jet black, blunt in my ear
Real relaxed, readin real loves stories like
Ceaser and Cleopatra, we need another actress to play her
Cause Liz Taylor's hot, but the Egyptian queen
On the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava
Hopped in the shower, threw on the boxers with the baby oil
Baby powder, night owl, movin to later hours, only
Fuckin with kings, niggas official
If you phony, come in the circle, niggas'll diss you
We converse on the state of hip hop
We share the same views and feelings
He sling cain, crib costin 2 million
He plan to leave the streets forever
But niggas that wanted him left him 
Dead in the streets 'fore I can tell him</pre>
