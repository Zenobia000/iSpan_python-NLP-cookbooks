Artist: Nas f/ Lake
Album:  God's Son
Song:   Revolutionary Warfare
Typed by: theGodsun7@hotmail.com

[Lake] uh uh huh, lets go, yeah!
[Nas] Uh, ghetto children singing "singing"
[Nas] See they eager to learn "uh hum"
[Nas] how to become the next world leaders "Bravehearts"!

Chorus:[Nas]
Revolutionary warfare is all fair loving war for the cause
I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare is all fair loving war for the cause
I gotta take you off here

[Nas]
Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques
Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness, in all them
Gotta shoot only if necessary 
Homey vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time
Where Arian nations ain't having integration, we so blind
The beauty of life, was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right, "Jesus"!
What is he like? I picture him standing with diamonds on him
Little different from the way my mommy saw him
Practice your aiming, physical training in, difficult terrain and
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging
Splitting dutches up, strap up, the armies is school 
Teaching smart ways to kill, I'm thinking Ghandi was a fool
But chronic's a fool; got me thinking out loud, fuck it
Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out 

[Chorus]

[Lake]
My revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's, I build
With dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill, in dix hills
for fish scale, to cop guns, the time come
I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus
Fuck the beef I'll snatch your seed, from chuckie cheese 
And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's 
Black fatigues and ? on the sofa
50 inch flat screen Louie Vitton holdsters
My motions don't appeal to repel at divisions
I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system
I'm like a modern day Hitler, black gorilla, crip and blood in one nigga
Only killas know my face
I beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake
Though simultaneously the street revolution 
21 gun salute the new Huey Newton 

[Chorus]

[Nas][Lake]
[N] Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to his fathers
[N] Protect the children, grab revolvers
[N] The women plays important part of our life force
[N] So what we fight for, my heart goes to you beautiful wife in war
[L] Uh, And listen more talk less
[L] Watch all and trust none, demand your respect
[L] And be ready to die for what you believe in
[L] And ride all the time not just when convenient 
[N] Justice and freedom, wisdom and understanding
[N] We the lost children of Israel in this western world region
[N] You ain't a man you a coward if you cant support the girl you put a seed in
[L] Strong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong
[L] It's more to a war than just getting it on
[L] Conceal your form, cover your tracks
[L] Stay prepared I don't care if no one's spared

Chorus: x2</pre>
