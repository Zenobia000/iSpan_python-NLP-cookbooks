Uh
Crazy (crazy) Ah (ah)
Yo pussy kill me...
Huh (huh).. yeah (yeah) yeah..
Huh, huh, huh ,huh..

[Nas]
Pussy kill me when I was born (what)
Pardon me, I rephrase it departed mami wounded decaying
I look at the bright sight
That the fact that I got a life sight
Born '73 September right now (true)
Virgo child the first thing I learn is money makes the world go ground
On this planet is ten women for one man I wonder how we manage
To say vows and walk a straight line in marriage
Niggas is some nasty creatures (word)
Bitches even nastier they throw at you boy and is hard for me to pass it up
Freaky hoes, lick a niggas ass and nuts
Stupid bitch brag and tell a baby dad with nuts (stipid bitch)
Now he looking for me two cars deep
Rolling up on niggas barrel out the window asking you Nas peeps
I can't had that two four five nigga grad that
Pass it to me suck up for love niggas I blast that
I swear my dick is going to get my in trouble
I piss at bubbles
I thought I felt the sharp pain better stick to rubbers
When laying hooker after hooker day out and day in
Watch out for diseases that doctors can't name'em
Just a thought we all fucked all the same chicks
Some play like they innocent fucking entertainers
And basketball players the bitch is a hoe
But some of yall a save her put your dick in her throat
You just a nigga that wipe her (huh) she drove you crazy
Now your monkey ass wanna shoot the pimp that pipes her
She had your baby now you a life-er (damn)
And suicide notes you write her
Pussy kills..

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Ow what a thrill
That's how a bitch feel
Gotta be strong to handle it is real
Pussy kills
Backs shots keep a nigga open
Bitch a have niggas gun smoking, huh
Pussy kills

[Nas]
My nigga James got married same girl he went to school with
Nice girl nerd with glasses he was too stunt
Studied for her Masters part time nurse
I'll tell you how superb the ass is but who's looking
I mean that's my man maybe I just took a peek
Maybe I wondered what it would be like (sike)
Cus James is a need life I was with AZ like
Look and hands solo fucking with niggas girls forbidden that's a no no
Is death men we real niggas civilize gods
And their aint too many niggas like Nas I'm trust worthy
Plus I know a dude that catch his wife cheating                      
Kill his baby, kill his wife and took his own life even
Happy for James cus real bitches is hard to come by
This nigga found one I told him his lucky we clown some
Rolling up dutchies will watching Royed Jones in round one he froze
Put his face to the tv bout an inch close
Move out the way nigga fucks the matter with you you blind
He pointed to the front door thought he was loosing his mind
She 'pose to be with her sick mother left for the weekend
Was stressed when she was leaving
Now she's next to some nigga cheating
(Gasping for air, coughing)
He picture'em making noises grinding'em and kissing'em
Yelling aint no telling we her lips a been
Left her messages she came home no lesser than ten minutes
Later then they start wrestling and screaming
She said she missed her flight that evening
She never left she was never at the fight you speaking
That's Vegas this is New York you bugging
I held up my hand for a that but he wouldn't touch it
I'am like when did you start acting like that this is dumbness
Gave me a crazy look and started swinging punches
I ducked couldn't believe it that nigga so wip
He got his gat and started squeezing hit two police men
Neighbors dialed 911 they heard a thumping
Wounded cops kicked in the door and started dumping
Me and his wife dip to the floor she smelled strange
My comrade was breathing no more they killed James

[Chorus]</pre>
