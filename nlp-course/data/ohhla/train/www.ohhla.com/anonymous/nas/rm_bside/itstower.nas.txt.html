[Rick Ross]
Me and Nas

[Nas]
Well let's ride tonight, it's a Tower Heist
Yep, uh, yeah, yo

Born NYC, beasting, the Lord left me no choice
Christian pendants, Islamic thoughts, criminal courts
Father forgive, I wanna die like Godfather did
Standing in lineups, I'm paying lawyers, ain't trying to bid
Alliance's Surveillance watching 'em, careful when plotting
My boys were captured on video, farewell to my partners
Ski masks with fake tags in case the car was spotted
Lavish hotels, Central Park West, fly apartments
Let's rob it, forensics get us sentenced so we the smartest
It's +livest+ as Saturday Night as I load up a cartridge
Let off the fully, got alibis, no need to worry
Done right, we don't see the prosecutors or grand jury
Reputed mobster style, take the money and run
Count it in warehouses, leave town and live a hundred years like crocodiles
Straight up NYC like a Mets fitted
This a Tower Heist, even Donald Trump can get it

[Chorus 1: Nas]
You want respect, money and power right?
Well let's ride tonight, it's a Tower Heist
You want respect, money and power right?
Well let's ride tonight, it's a Tower Heist
Tower Heist
"Maybach Music"
Even Donald Trump can get it

[Rick Ross]
I got my shades on, got my money in my pocket
Got my Js on, spend a hundred for my watch
I feel amaz-on, it's a +jungle+ in these streets
Choppers be going bang, your people need to be deceased
Every day is war, living legends you must applaud
So light my cigar, one for the foreigners living large
Dealing straight raw, the Mercedes in my garage
Your girl on my dick and I may just feel like menage
I came for the cash, me and Nas behind the mask
cause bitch, it's a Heist, give me ice or lose your life
My profit's so nice, me and dog gon' count it twice
It's popping tonight, roll the weed, give me your light, huhh~!

[Chorus 2: Nas]
You want respect, money and power right?
Well let's ride tonight, it's a Tower Heist
You want respect, money and power right?
Well let's ride tonight, it's a Tower Heist
Tower Heist, straight up Tower Heist
Even Donald Trump can get it

[Outro: Nas] + (Rick Ross)
You want respect, money and power right? (Huhh~!)
You want respect, money and power right?
It's a Tower Heist</pre>
