Artist: Nas f/ Akon & Ali Vegas
Album:  Shakedown Remix 12"
Song:   Shakedown Remix
Typed by: DaSun Akbar

[Nas (Akon)]
Shakedown (Uh-oh-oh); Akon, Nas, here we go New York
(Uh-oh-oh) Here we go world, here we go y'all
(Uh-oh-oh, 'Cause it's a shakedown, uh-oh-oh)

[Ali Vegas]
The streets'll do whatever just to see me fail
Mama'll do whatever to keep free from jail
So she tellin' me to get my CDL
But papi said he got some things that we could sell
To turn the corner and to see VVS's
He said you liked girls to get beneath their dresses
You gon' need them SS's, VVS's, BBS's
Here go the keys to the Lexus (Uh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the center of attention like Kareem and them
My squad run around the borough like we Prem' and them
My gang with big truck, wifey's we beamin' them
Let's Esco, that tag team from Queens again
This is Shakedown, here go the breakdown
The big boys are back; 'lil niggaz get off the playground
I got up with the homey A now
The kid babies 'bout to make the Earth quake now

[Chorus: Akon (Nas)]
Uh-oh-oh, we back now
A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down (Lay it down)
And give 'em all you got, 'cause it's a shakedown (Shakedown)
Uh-oh-oh, (New York to H-Town)
We back now (Here we go y'all)
A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down
(Uh-oh, Nas and Akon, uh-oh, Nas and Akon)
And give 'em all you got, 'cause it's a shakedown
Uh-oh-oh, (Here we go)

[Nas]
My man was smart
Robbed the bank, buried the cash
Did ten years, came home and bought him a Jag
Other side of town, stick-up kids ride around
Young niggaz not prepared this time around
Walk in the jewelry store yellin', "Get on the floor"
Snatched the sales lady up, hit her with the bulldog
Grabbin' the ice, the heist went fast as the Vice
Had rushed in, bussin', could you imagine this life?
The streets come alive and laugh at your sorrows
Leavin' your soul hollow
That you fill it back up liquor bottles
Black Messiah had the jux, 20 ki's uncooked
Easy to push, some Japanese dealers were crooks
They leave niggaz eyes cut out; what it means to us
He seen too much, but we don't give a fuck
Black truck pull up to the door
Infa-green night vision lens we can see through the war
"Get on the floor"

[Chorus: Akon]
We back now
A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down
And give 'em all you got, 'cause it's a shakedown
Uh-oh-oh
Do I make myself clear, uh-oh-oh</pre>
