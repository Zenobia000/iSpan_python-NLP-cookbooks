Typed by: dy_face@yahoo.com

[Opening Skit: Ken Staton, Sadat X, Q-Tip]
[-] Word is bond! you got six millions on that jack hero, this shit is real
[+] Aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo, aiyyo check this shit out, man
[-] Aiyyo God, give me a cigarette man!
[+] Yo! here you go, here you go, here you go, Come On!!
[-] Check it out man, check out what I got here, man
[+] You know I got to check this, what is that?!
[-] Yo, this some letter I've got from my man Nas, man ~ Word is Bond!
[+] What it said, kid?!

[Verse One: Nas]
What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came, you shouldn't slid into my crib
Fuck it black, no time for looking back, it's done
Plus congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flipping, talking about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffing, while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, Shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fucking with the niggaz from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerrome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry Nines
And night time there's more tripe than ever
What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say What's Up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove

[Chorus: X2]
[Q-Tip] One what?
[Nas:-] One Love
[Ken-S] One Love, One Love
[Q-Tip] One Love, One Love
[Ken-S] One Love, One Love
[Q-Tip] One Love, One Love
[Ken-S] One Love means keeping it Real

[Verse Two: Nas]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York, the same shit is going on
The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
The nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurting something
Word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block, your man gave him your glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets, I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with an ox for the phone piece
Wilding on the Island, but now with Elmira
Better chill cause them niggaz will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote, you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain when you come home the corner's ours
On the reels, all these crab niggaz know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom Dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwilding in Four Maine he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key
So stay civilized, time flies, though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me wanna murder, for real-a
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs for one love

[Chorus: X2]
[Ken-S] One Love, One Love
[Q-Tip] One Love, One Love
[Ken-S] One Love, One Love
[Q-Tip] One Love, One Love
[Ken-S] One Love means keeping it Real

[Verse Three: Nas]
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinking how can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the week and hitting L's while I'm sleeping
A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the Nine at home
You see the streets have me stressed something terrible
Fucking with the corners, have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or H.D.M., hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum State Pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but shorty doo-wop
Rolling two phillies together in the Bridge we called them Oowops
He said, "Nas, niggaz could be busting off the roof
So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black treys-deuce"
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black
We was chilling on these bitches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took an L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted, he starts talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggaz fool him
Cause when the pistol blows the ones that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggaz are struck, families fucked up
Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man that I'm a go Cyprose
There's some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for jake Shorty, what one love

[Chorus: X2]
[Ken-S] One Love, One Love
[Q-Tip] One Love, One Love
[Ken-S] One Love, One Love
[Q-Tip] One Love, One Love

[Outro: Ken Staton]
Uhhhh.. One Love means keeping it Real
All of the brothers that left up down, keep that One love
For the brothers out in the East, keep that One love
For all the brothers Uptown, keep that One love
For all the brothers in jail, keep that One love
One Love means keeping it Real!</pre>
