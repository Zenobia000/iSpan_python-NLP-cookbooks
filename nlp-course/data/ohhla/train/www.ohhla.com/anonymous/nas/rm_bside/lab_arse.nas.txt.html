[Verse One: AZ the Visualiza]
Visualizin the realism of life and actuality
Fuck who's the baddest a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is, money orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as five percenters
But somethin must of got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some, restin in peace and some are sittin in San Quentin
Others such as myself are tryin to carry on tradition
Keepin the schwepervesence street ghetto essence inside us
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go
but as long as we leavin thievin we'll be leavin with some kind of dough
so, and to that day we expire and turn to vapors
me and my capers-ll be somewhere stackin plenty papers
Keepin it real, packin steel, gettin high
Cause life's a bitch and then you die

[Chorus: AZ the Visualiza]
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go (Go!)
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye
Cause you never know when you're gonna go (Go!)
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go (Go!)
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye.....

"Time's is Illmatic" 4x
"Destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it" 1x

"You gotta get the ground beneath your feet, partner
Get the wind behind your back
Go out in a blaze of glory if you've got to
Otherwise you ain't shit
You might as well be dead your damn self, y'all"

[Verse Two: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day, I'm twenty years of blessing
The essence of adolescent leaves my body now I'm fresh in
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life some God-ly like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
my skull cause it's pain in my brain vein money maintain
Don't go against the grain simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners take they wallets they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects flashin my quick cash
and got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
Now I think about cash in abundance, niggaz I used to run with
is rich or doin years in the hundreds
I switched my motto -- instead of sayin fuck tomorrow
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time's is Illmatic keep static like wool fabric
Pack a four-matic that crack your whole cabbage

[Chorus]

Yeah, you know the flavor
Nas & AZ on the remix joint
This is another explosion from the Arsenal</pre>
