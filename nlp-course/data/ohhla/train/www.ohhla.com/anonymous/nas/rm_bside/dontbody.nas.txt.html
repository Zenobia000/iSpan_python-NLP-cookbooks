Hope y'all make it through the storm
You know what though, I love the rain man
A lot you cats are runnin your mouths
Your runnin your mouths crazy
Think y'all got to ease up though, you know
Ease up fore somethin happen man
We don't want that
At least you don't
Be easy man
Tell you how it feels to be on top of the world
But y'all nigga betta take it slow
Don't body ya self
Don't body ya self
Don't body ya self nigga

Yeah, yeah
Everybody get low niggaz
Dedicated to the fuck Nas coalition
Touch my dough I'm lettin .40 cals blow nigga
Not cals with four legs
But cals with more lead
That add up more dead
It's on nigga
I'm a bury them
Niggaz don't want beef they vegetarian
Scared of pussy you climbed out a caesarian
I push ya grown ass back in your mothers womb
You need nine more mouths
Your crews nine more punks
You rhyme on stuff and claim I didn't sign y'all up
If I sign y'all I'm on dust
Ya we from the same hood but nigga what?!
When y'all was tryin to rap y'all was makin me proud
Man now you fucked up, down on your luck, runnin your mouth man
Why don't be a real man, say you need a lil help
And I might help your ass off the shelf
But noooo, you're bein disrespectful
Thinkin son so cool that he won't check you
Stand down, the king is home
Queens is on, NASDAQ, Dow Jones

Don't body ya self
Crazy
Take it slow man
Slow down
Take it slow motherfucker
Don't body ya self
Let's listen
Let's just listen
Don't body ya self
Listen
Slow down though man
Slow down
Ya'll gotta take it slow

I am De Niro after Am.Ex. commercials and "The Fockers"
With Martin Scorsese after Gangs Of New York could rock this
Back together with the master plan
The rebirth of Langston Hughes, I'm that man
I'm in the streets like old graffiti
I'm hearin wankstas talkin greasy
Whether broke or rich my friend
Nasir bring that career to an end
And I'm bored with you MCs B
Ya'll beneath me
And my raps bring horror like a board of Ouiji
Of course I'm the king, get my shine on
And I blind y'all cause they call me "The Lord of the Rings"
Pinky heavy man, big stones in the weddin ban
Smell of brimstone back from Hell again
Next verse gets worse from God's son to Devil's sin

Ya'll need to take it slow
Don't body ya self
Motherfucker act like ya know (05')
Motherfucker better take it slow
Don't body ya self

They say Jada defeated him
Joe to street for him
What's next? I guess it's for Nas to ether him
Ya'll awaiting an MC burial
This is ethereal, FM stereo to XM radio
What does it mean he thoreal? Hmm.. whether heavenly or spiritual
Extreme, delicately like in a way that seems too perfect for this world
Man that is ritous, faithful and keeps law
Will surely live to cleanse the soverend Lord
And you are none of the above
So you a sucka for death if I'm a sucka for love
And ya wanna know why I don't got an answer niggaz
Cause I truely understand these niggaz
Scared of me so they talk about family members
Like I can't point out your grandma to niggaz
Damn you was my man like crew dawg
Don't make me change your body frame to blue fog
The Q is the borrow of true dons
Any disrespect nigga we chose arms
Will it be gilmore or crowes?

Nigga act like ya know
Yeah
Ya betta take it slow
Motherfucker act like ya know
Mess around and body ya self
Don't body ya self</pre>
