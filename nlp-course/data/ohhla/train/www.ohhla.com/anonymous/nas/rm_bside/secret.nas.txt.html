"Watch Out"----8X

[Nas]
There's a man who live the life of danger
To everyone he meets stays as stranger
With every move he makes, another chance he takes
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow

He's secret agent man, amazing man
Check how he walks, how he talks, how he lays his plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give you a number then take away your name

Secret agent man, amazing man
Check how he walks how he talks how he lays the plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give you a number then take away your name

Beware of pretty faces that you find
A pretty face can hide an evil mind
Be careful what you say, or you'll give yourself away
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow
agent man, amazing man
Check how he walks, how he talks, how he lays his plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They gave him a number and took away his name

He's secret agent man, amazing man
Check how he walks, how he talks, how he lays his plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give you a number then take away your name

Yeah, (secret) yeah, (secret) yeah (secret) yeah, (secret)

Secret agent man, amazing man
Check how he walks, how he talks, how he lays his plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give you a number then take away your name

Swinging in the Riviera one day
Then laying in the Bombay alley the next day
Oh no, who let the wrong word slip
While kissing them persuasive lips
The odds are I won't live to see tomorrow
I'm secret agent man, amazing man
How I walk and talk and lays my plan
Agent man advance the game
They give you a number then take your name
He's the, agent man, amazing man
Check how he walks how he talks how he lays his plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give you a number then take away your name

"Watch Out" ---6X

Uh, secret agent man
Uh, uh, more bullet proof than a spook of set by the door
More legend than 007, more raw
