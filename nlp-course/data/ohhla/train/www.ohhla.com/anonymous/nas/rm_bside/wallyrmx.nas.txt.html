Oh yeah mutha fucka that's that shit

[Nas]
Ladies make it hot

[Chorus]
oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang,

oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang,
oo-chie wally wally

He really really work my body
He really really turned me out
He really really got to gut me
He really really made me scream and shout
He really taught me how to work my body
He really taught me how to go down south
He really really tried to hurt me hurt me
I really love thug and gangsta style

[Nas]
Yo we got chicks in the living room 
Getting it on and they leaving till 6 in the morning
Always for oochie
Oh you ain't know
How many hoes in the bankroll
Sort of like like the game show
Who wants to be a millionaire 
But my name ain't Regis 
Nas the one they call 
When they want there thing beat up
Honeys' with bodies 
With Bravehearts guns in the party
Waves, braids, and boldly,
Trademarks to army
Is that Horse it must be
I heard he husky
Yeah, there go jungle eyes red 
Looking for trouble
And that's Nas dancing with dimes
But who's his manage
The imperial thug
Is cold deep grand wiz 
We taking honeys' to the crib tonite
Grantee we going up in there rib tonite
Check the new slang
It's changed the braveheart gang bang
When you see me pass
Holla oochie bang bang   

[Naish]
Yeah what up ma, 
take a look, you hypnotized
on how my long dick stretch your insides
for real ma, with your thick lips and thick thighs
stoke both holes, pass it to Nas
or pass it to Naish, or pass it to Jung
or pass it to Horse, then that ass gettin tossed
fuck a hustler book, penthouse or blacktale
i got bitches sendin my niggas flicks in jail
i fuck a bitch face more than her waist for real
and aint no pussy like new pussy thats how a nigga feel
bust three times throw her the peace sign
she sleep then my dick sleek and I aint gotta call her for weeks
Long leg hoes, mo'head hoes, married bitches
Me and my dog - fuckin them both they got us switchin 
Is the nigga gangsta?  Yeah, that's how I'm livin
That's how I'm playin - I got these freak fuckin hoes singin

[chorus]

[Jungle]
Little young thing go around my dick with your tongue ring
Deep throat my nine inch, gut from the front and
grind from the side and, fuck from behind and
Grab her hair slap her ass, she screamin like she dyin
Make her come four times without even tryin
I'll beat that pussy up there's no denyin
Hit her where she doodie at, make that booty fat
Little cutie rat, walking by with the doobie wrap
Tight blue jeans, air max
Small gucci bag
No loot and no job
Stay home giving blow jobs
Like no prob, it's simple
Holla out the window it's the project nympho
Fuck my whole crew, you know how we do
you got that good pussy I can share with my peoples
Be a brave girl, do your thang
Let them tities hang, I'll have all the bitches sayin

[chorus]

[Horse]
When it comes to sex I'm similar to the thriller in manilla
Bitches call me Horse the pussy filler
I'll fuck a big boned or slim chick
Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch
Aint no sleepin in my bedroom
When henny's in my dick
When Flex drop the bomb i bust a nut on this bitch
Deep throat, ceaser gold or pun wicked hoes
Who like the way i thug and the way i flow
I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe
Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof
Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth
Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot
Like Nia Lomg in a cherry thong with the lights on
Sippin Perignon with Kelly Price on
I pull out my python, I hit it while my wife's gone
Long dick the bitch all night, I'll make her pussy sing the song

[2nd chorus till the end]
oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
oo-chie wally wally</pre>
