[Intro] (Nas)
Chi-ching, haa, chi-ching, haa

[Chorus]
(Nas)
Take a picture, cherish it, I'm God's Son, inherence it
This is level 7 where gangster and mobsters stepping
(Nashawn)
Take a picture, cherish it, its Nashawn
my feature is heaven, safe for the bitches, this is level 7

[Nas]
Number 1, uhh what does it take to have a woman's bra?

[Nashawn]
Intelligently they mind done

[Nas]
And what about shopping and copping expensive things

[Nashwan]
Take them on yachts and lobster, rocks and rings

[Nas]
? Crash with a transvestite on its best night
but nigga not me on a hot night
I'm with a sister whose thick as shit and she knock me

[Nashawn]
You hit her off properly then let her get on top of me
level 2 is elementary stage

[Nas]
The first thing a slave learned is its country amazing

[Nashawn]
They separated the families on ever plantation

[Nas]
Feeing for that black pussy, slaves masters chasing

[Nashawn]
Chase they women like they chicken feet
violating, raping 'em
rip their clothes, let their niggaz see

[Nas]
And that's the start of the first black pimps history

[Nashawn]
Told his queen if they want to fuck, make them pay a fee

[Chorus] - 2X

[Nas]
Level 3, God answer me, is there any devil in me?

[Nashawn]
Naw there's thug and there's rebel in me

[Nas]
Hood like ghetto tears falling down my eyes

[Nasahwn]
How about the staircase, kill them with a surprise

[Nas]
I'm willing to live and willing to die

[Nashawn]
Kill a man for a cause, I'm willing to fry

[Nas]
While my people say it's a fucked up predicament

[Nashawn]
You talk the wrong thing, school learned ignorance

[Nas]
Now my religion is the all mighty Dallam

[Nashawn]
There's everybody making this money
turn this street game to pimp game scholar

[Nas]
Level 4, never make a whore to a house wife
with my charisma

[Nashawn]
It takes a special kind of dude just to pimp her

[Nas]
Level 5, I leaned the ways of the streets when I was only 9

[Nashawn]
Turn nothing into a dime, beer into wine

[Nas]
Wine into Champaign, Chris, level 6

[Nashawn]
Only millionaire shit, buying buildings, and real estate
me and my gorillas chill to sell a home away

[Nas]
Went from savvy to humane
welcome to level 7, enter the life of true fame

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
