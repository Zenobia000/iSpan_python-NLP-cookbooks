Artist: Nas f/ AZ
Album:  Stillmatic
Song:   The Flyest
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Nas] Geah
[AZV] Peace king
[Nas] Peace king
[AZV] Listen, they wrote a book on your life
[Nas] Right
[AZV] You think anybody'll read it?
[Nas] No fuckin doubt!
[AZV] Let's make history homey
[Nas] Aight then
[AZV] You know we brought the hoes clothes and money rolls to the table
[Nas] {*laughing*} No, fuckin, doubt
[AZV] It's time to manifest this
[Nas] Shit we the flyest nigga
[AZV] Bring it to a whole, y'know?
[Nas] Gangsta nigga

[Chorus]
Niggaz better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin, so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggaz that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin out stacks and mackin out hoes
Pushin big dicks and packin our chrome
We the flyest gangsters

[AZ]
Follow, I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo
Coupe VT, it's like DVD when I flow
Feel me, I'm loved like the great late Malik Sealy
The one the player haters hate dearly, but can't near me
Homicide can't scare me
I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga
The type that can build with ya
Verbalize bring life to a still picture, it's God-given
Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty
Truly my only duty is to dodge prison
Play wit me, I'm modest 'til them strays hit me
Regardless the circumstances I'ma stay filthy
Dough forever, the live stay low forever
And fuck niggaz, cause it's hard to keep them close together
One dependant, no wife, one co-defendant
No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance

[Chorus]

[Nas]
I do what I can do when I can do it
Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feelin
Live how I live it's only cause I been through it
Learn to try it like to eat it and shit it's nuttin to it
Burn it light it weed it and off the liquor, while drivin outside
I'll never catch a vehicular homicide
My music is a description of my vibe of course
My life, my sites, my thoughts, what I like on my fork
Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands
to wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they stayin, evil be gone, say it
I'm proud of Mase for giving himself to the Lord
Wonderin does Faith, think about Big anymore
Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changin
We ain't these little niggaz no more, runnin dangerous
I like to bone, I'm a peaceful brother
Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover
Be havin they legs shakin, stab 'em, break 'em
I'm Hercules Hercules when havin relations, the flyest

[Chorus]

[Nas] We put this on the, soul of our born
[AZV] As we hold the Qu'ran
[Nas] Kamikaze style
[AZV] Older cats coachin us on
[Nas] Yo it's kill or be killed
[AZV] Understand, real'll be real
[Nas] A forty-shot spectrum MAKE YOUR WHOLE EMBASSY KNEEL
[AZV] Identity sealed, protected by
[Nas] our energy shield
[AZV] And fuck a drop, cause that's that shit that got Kennedy killed
[Nas] Close the books
[AZV] Was taught never expose a crook
[Nas] Between the knight and the bishop
[AZV] Wanna knock ya rook; I'm a rare breed never had a fair to lead
[Nas] I ain't light niggaz recite
[AZV] Too impaired to breathe
[Nas] WE BOTH HARD HIT JUST LIKE CAMACHO AND VARGAS, WHO'S THE TARGET?
[Nas] Now watch how we close the market, motherfuckers

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
