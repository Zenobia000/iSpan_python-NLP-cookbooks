Artist: Nas & Damian Marley
Album:  Distant Relatives
Song:   As We Enter
Typed by: Dopeskill@gmail.com

[Damian Marley]
As we enter
Come now we take you on the biggest adventure

[Nas]
Must be dementia, that you ever thought
You could touch our credentials, what's the initials?

[Damian Marley]
You be Jamrock the lyrical official
Send out the order, laws and the rituals

[Nas]
Burn candles, say prayers, paint murals
It is truth we big news, we hood heroes

[Damian Marley]
Break past the anchor, we come to conquer
Man a badman, we no play Willy Wonka

[Nas]
And I got the guns

[Damian Marley]
I got the ganja

[Nas]
And we could blaze it up on your block if you want to
Or haze it up stash box in a Hummer
Or you could run up and get done up

[Damian Marley]
Or get something that you want none of
Unlimited amount you collect from us
Direct from us, street intellectuals

[Nas]
And I'm shrewd about decimals
And my man'll speak Patois
And I can speak rap star
Y'all feel me even if it's in Swahili
Habari Gani

[Damian Marley]
Mzuri Sana
Switch up the language and move to Ghana

[Nas]
Salute and honor, real revolution rhymers

[Damian Marley]
Rhythm piranhas

[Nas]
Like true Obamas, unfold the drama

[Nas]
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream "murder" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it

[Damian Marley]
Queens to Kingston
Gunshot we use and govern the kingdom

Rise of the Winston, I can see the fear up in your eyes
Realize you can die any instant

[Damian Marley]
And I can hear the sound of a voice
When you must lose your life like mice in the kitchen

[Nas]
Snitching, I can see him pissing on hisself
And he's wetting up his thighs and he trying to resist it

[Damian Marley]
Switching, I can smell him digging up shit like a fly
Come around and be persistent

[Nas]
That's how you end up in a hitlist

[Damian Marley]
Ain't no bad man business

[Nas]
No evidence

[Damian Marley]
Crime scene, fingerprint-less

[Nas]
Flow effortless

[Damian Marley]
Casual like the weekends

[Nas]
No pressure when

[Damian Marley]
We're comfy and decent

[Nas]
We set this off beasting

[Damian Marley]
Hunting season

[Nas]
And, frankly speaking...
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream "murder" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream "murder" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it</pre>
