Artist: Nas & Damian Marley
Album:  Distant Relatives
Song:   Count Your Blessings
Typed by: eclipse_leo@msn.com

[CHORUS 1 – JR GONG]
And I've got studios to voice in
And I've got news for rejoicing
Now a new sun is rising
I count my blessings

That I'm safe when I'm resting
Furniture in my nesting
Not by force
I'm suggesting
You count your blessings

I've got love and assurance
I've got new heath insurance
I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here
Together after
Better count your blessings

[VERSE 1 – NAS]
Count your blessings
Cause yo' 
This year
Can't wait ‘till he gets here
7/21/09
My first son will shine
And it's amazing
I'm about to be raising
Another made man
And like his dad 
They'll praise him
And some will hate him
Just cause we're building a nation
Like Bob did with Damian 
The world will embrace him
Girls will chase him
Foresee they will not break him
And when I'm not around
You look for God
And thank him

[CHORUS 2 – JR GONG]
And I've got somewhere to dress for
And I've got no need to stress for
And so I'll always put my best forth
And count my blessings

And there'll be no need for tissues
Cause there'll be no further issues
If you've got someone who miss you
Man count your blessings

And I've got love and assurance
And I've got new heath insurance
And I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here
Together after
Better count your blessings

[VERSE 2 – NAS]
You're wishing
You were sitting
In the top position
Picture perfect
Nothing less cause you deserve it
Without the Hermes
You never hurting
You knew that you was 
Destined for greatness 
For certain
But see the over zealous
They be thirsting
Caught up in emotion
You're keeping your composure
Like Gershwin
Songs by Earth, Wind
Keep you in a zone
Writing verses
So when your pocket's light
Know that you have a heavy purpose

[CHORUS 3 – JR GONG]
We've got pre-school and day care
We've got pension and well-fare
And though not all will play the game fair
Still I count my blessings

I've got joy in abundance
I've got life full of substance
I've got meetings and functions
So I count my blessings

I've got something to live for
I've got surplus to give more
And we're all welcome through his door
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here
Together after
So I count your blessings

[VERSE 3 – NAS]
I think you're looking too hard for it
Want the double R 
Under your garage door
Appreciate the things you work hard for
And count your blessing
Count your blessings
So don't be mad if you ain't fly y'all
You got the means 
To reach the level I'm on
You should know that there's only one Nas
Y'all
But count your blessing
Count your blessing
Ra!

[CHORUS 4 – JR GONG]
And I've got studios to voice in
And I've got news for rejoicing
Now a new son is rising
I count my blessings

That I'm safe when I'm resting
Furniture in my nesting
Not by force
I'm suggesting
You count your blessings

I've got love and assurance
I've got new heath insurance
I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here
Together after
Better count your blessings</pre>
