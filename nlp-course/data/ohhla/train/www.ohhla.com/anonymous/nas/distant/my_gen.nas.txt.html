Album:  Distant Relatives
Song:   My Generation
Typed by: eclipse_leo@msn.com

[CHORUS]
My Generation will make a change
This Generation will make a change 
My Generation will make a change
This Generation will make a change

[VERSE 1 JR GONG]
Now mi love fi see the schoolas dem a graduate
A study hard and save the party for the holidays
Diplomatic with dem Diploma 
And them bound fi great
Because dem nah pick up no matic and a perpetrate
And then I love the energies whe dem a generate
My Generation it so special it will make a change
Because the elders sew the seed and it a germinate
So anytime dem see the progress dem a celebrate
Because we rising up despite of the economy
And then a we a star the show like the astronomy
And how we keep on breaking through is an anomaly
Because we keep remaining true without apology
The mission ha to carry through and finish properly
Say Gambia to Guadeloupe Paris to Napoli
Say Zambia to Honolulu back to Tripoli
And everybody want a future living happily

[CHORUS]
My Generation will make a change
This Generation will make a change 
My Generation will make a change
This Generation will make a change

[VERSE 2 NAS]
Can you blame my generation
Subjected gentrification
Depicting they're frustrations
Over ill instrumentation
Cause music is the way to convey to you what I'm facing
Placing my life in-front of your eye for your observation
Now if you can't relate then maybe you are too complacent
Athletes today are scared to make Mohammad Ali statements
What's up with tomorrow?
Will you lead will you follow?
Improve you values
Education is real power
I reach 'em like Bono
So get rid of your self-sorrow
Add some bravado
Get wealthy like Wells Fargo
It's true that I am you
And I am proof
Surviving through
We do what we got to do
Yow we can break the cycle
Let nobody lie to you
Then maybe put our sons and our daughters in private school
Cause there's a mission we gotta finish before we leave
This generation is destined to do historic deeds

[CHORUS]
My Generation will make a change
This Generation will make a change 
My Generation will make a change
This Generation will make a change

[VERSE 3 LIL WAYNE]
If you weather that storm
Then that Rain bring Sun
Been a long time coming
I know change go' come
Man I gotta keep it moving
To the beat of my drum
Last night I set the future 
At the feet of my son
But they thinking that my Generation
Gotta die young
If we all come together
Then they can't divide one
Don't worry 'bout it
Just be about it
Got a message from God
Heaven too crowded
But I say 
Hey Young World!
You never looked better
And I heard change start
With the man in the mirror
Uh!
This Generation
I'm a represent
A generation led by a Black President
Now how's that for change?
Who knew that could change?
I don't even look at the flag the same 
Heak, Uh!
So when you finish reading Revelations
Thank God for my Generation</pre>
