Artist: Nas & Damian Marley
Album:  Distant Relatives
Song:   In His Own Words
Typed by: eclipse_leo@msn.com

[CHORUS 1 STEPHEN MARLEY]
JAH TOLD YOU 
IN HIS OWN WORDS
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
TO GUIDE YOU 
THROUGH THIS COLD WORLD
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
JAH TOLD YOU 
IN HIS OWN WORDS
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
TO GUIDE YOU 
THROUGH THIS COLD WORLD
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"

[VERSE 1 NAS]
Two steps away from death
A vest and a holster
I detest detectives arresting us over
Weapons possession
They was checking the Rover
Inspecting the Tattoos
On my neck and my shoulder
How many times I'm one of six
Coffin holders
Or I'm
Sitting with goons in the visiting rooms
Flip it I could have been you
Behind state walls biddin'
These are the things that a G pray for
Acquit us
A little stash in the safe or
Little Shorty to wait for him
Or a Shorty to take the weight for him 
What really did I escape from?
Thought I saw Gods face
On the design in my vintage Claiborne
Swear I see Him every day ya'll
In a bus or the train or
The billboards out there that hang tall
I still give thanks for Him
Have faith for Him
No matter what His name's called
Seen!

[CHORUS 2 STEPHEN MARLEY]
JAH TOLD YOU 
IN HIS OWN WORDS
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
TO GUIDE YOU 
THROUGH THIS COLD WORLD
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"

[VERSE 2 JR. GONG]
Can you think of a color that you never seen?
Can you reminisce on places you never been?
Well is many are called
But them never deemed
Worthy for the cause
Cause them never clean
Help who help themselves
Jah nuh raffle dream
That's why me chummy with Jah Jah
Like a Cherubim
Keep we strong through the winter
Like an Evergreen
And all of us are more connected
Than it ever seemed
All things are related
And creation is a package
Generate together
And we increase the wattage
A how them a go manage?
Tell Babylon them can't do Rasta damage
Nor stop we through the passage
Jah did make a promise
God is always honest
Always keeps his word
Yow nuh care what the plan is
Don't be astonished
Stumbling bocks vanish
One day the meek gonna live inna di palace, Woah!

[CHORUS x2 STEPHEN MARLEY]
JAH TOLD YOU 
IN HIS OWN WORDS
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
TO GUIDE YOU 
THROUGH THIS COLD WORLD
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"

[VERSE 3 NAS]
Some ask me if I feel
That Zion is surreal
And in my songs 
Do I plan to expose and reveal
Word to the curb
That's under these chrome wheels
My homies is the only ones I'm taking care of
But severe reality starts to become more clear
And these know-it-all rappers
Have become more weird
As if they were superior
And fans are inferior
How I balance between the streets and the theories of
Collegiate literature 
I hold mirrors up
Give combinations of pain, joy, fear and love
Through my perspective 
I can see Jah reflection
In the highest definition
Getting high with my bredrin
Then I ask him why is Africans dying from circumcision
They lack proper surgeons and suffer malnutrition
Underestimate the wealth of their own wisdom
Its like its been exchanged for this penicillin
Seen

[CHORUS 4 x2 STEPHEN MARLEY]
JAH TOLD YOU 
IN HIS OWN WORDS
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
TO GUIDE YOU 
THROUGH THIS COLD WORLD
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"</pre>
