[CHORUS 1  - JR. GONG x2]
TRIBAL WAR
WE NUH WANT NO MORE A DAT 
Every man deserve to earn 
And every child deserve to learn, now 

TRIBAL WAR 
A NUH DAT WE A DEFEND 
Every man deserve a turn 
Like a flame deserve to burn 

[VERSE 1 - NAS]
Man what happened to us? 
Geographically they moved us 
From Africa 
We was once happiness pursuers 
Now we back stabbing, combative and abusive 
The African and Arab go at it they most Muslim 
Used to be moving in unison 
Disputes would end 
Bounty Hunters and Grape Street get cool again 
Some standard housing 
Got the young running rampant 
Wilding, for a Phantom 
He can style in 
Mask on his face 
Grabbing his Luger 
Saying, Ågnobody move or IÅfll shoot yaÅh 
Man youÅfre expiring 
Catch 25 and he does it like a man 
He sides with Black, 
White Pride and Mexican 
Survive the best he can 
Strap a shank to his thigh 
Why do we all collide? 
Why do the young die? 
Extortion, murder and burglary 
Tattoos his chest 
Says his enemies don't deserve to breathe

[CHORUS 2 - JR. GONG x2]
TRIBAL WAR 
WE NUH WANT NO MORE A DAT 
Everyone deserve to earn 
And every child deserve to learn, Lord 

TRIBAL WAR 
A NUH DAT WE A DEFEND 
Each and every man deserve a turn 
Like a flame deserve to burn 

[VERSE 2 - K'naan]
I drink poison 
Then I vomit diamonds 
I gave you Mandela, Black Dalai Lamas 
I gave you music 
You enthused in my kindness 
So how dare you reduce me to Donny Imus 
Timeless in case we never been acquainted 
Flyness who made it 
It gets duplicated 
Mindless violence 
Well let me try to paint it 
HereÅfs the 5 steps 
In hopes to explain it 
One! 
Its me and my Nation against the World 
Two! 
Then me and my Clan against the Nation 
Three! 
Then me and my FamÅf against the Clan 
Four! 
Then me and my brother we no hesitation 
Uh! 
Go against the FamÅf until they cave in 
Five! 
Now whoÅfs left in this deadly equation? 
ThatÅfs right, itÅfs me against my brother 
Then we point a Kalashnikov 
And kill one another 

[CHORUS 3 - JR. GONG x2]
TRIBAL WAR 
WE NUH WANT NO MORE A DAT 
Everyone deserve to earn 
And every child deserve to learn 

TRIBAL WAR 
A NUH DAT WE A DEFEND 
Every man deserve a turn 
Like a flame deserve to burn 

[VERSE 3 - JR. GONG]
Man a war Tribal 
Over Colors 
Over Money, over land, and over oil, and over God 
And over Idols, and even lovers 
Over breakfast, over dinner, over suppers 
Over Jungle, over Rema, over Buckers 
Over Brooklyn, over Queens, and over Rutgers 
Over Red, and over Blue, and over Chuckers 
Over Red and over Blue and UnderÅ]covers 
Tribal trouble 
The drive by s double 
Cause the youth dem nah go war 
And go fight with knuckle 
The two sides scuffle 
Vietnam nah go a war 
With no more Kung Fu Nun chuckle 
Missile and shuttle 
Huh 
And the Queen of England and Uncle Sam 
Dem a flex dem muscle 
The Tribal Hustle 
Blood Diamond Poodle 
Survival Struggle 

[CHORUS 4 - JR. GONG x2]
TRIBAL WAR 
WE NUH WANT NO MORE A DAT 
Everyone deserve to earn 
Every child deserve to learn 

TRIBAL WAR 
A NUH DAT WE A DEFEND 
Each and every man deserve a turn 
Like a flame deserve to burn</pre>
