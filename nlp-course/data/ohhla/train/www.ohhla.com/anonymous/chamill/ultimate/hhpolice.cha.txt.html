Artist: Chamillionaire f/ Slick Rick
Album:  Ultimate Victory
Song:   Hip Hop Police
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
Go, go, go, go, go, go - keep runnin homie
Go, go, go, go, go, go - they on the trail
Go, go, go, go, go, go - keep runnin homie
Go, go, go, go, go, go - they on the trail

[Chorus]
With so much drama in the industry, hip-hop police are listening
Be careful or you'll be history, looks like another unsolved mystery
It's murder~! (Murder, murder) Ahhh, it's murder! (Murder, murder)
Yeahh it's murder~! (Murder, murder) Somebody tell em it's murder
  Murder was the case - and they blamed me

[Chamillionaire]
Officer I didn't do it, you can't blame me for this
Could you please loosen up the handcuffs on my wrists?
You can call me what you wanna mayne but I ain't a snitch
No cooperation is exactly what you will get
'Til I talk til my lawyer, you get no reply
  You've obviously been watchin too much CSI
  I'm not a crash dummy so don't even try
  to talk your dirty trash to me, no BFI
  If you are not guilty of anything, then why did you run?
Cause you the police! And plus I saw you cockin your gun
And the chamber wasn't empty, it was obviously one
  If you think I'm believin that one then you're obviously dumb
Huh~?!
  I know that you heard the sirens, you dived in
  to the vehicle you was drivin and ridin in
  Instead you shouldn't be whinin, but abidin
  by the law, naww, it's obvious that you're lyin

[Chorus]

[Chamillionaire]
  Stop lyin to me boy, it'd be best you confess
  I can smell the BS on the scent of your breath
  Saw the +Meth+ while I was +Inspectin+ your +Deck+
  Saw that you was "Ridin' Dirty" when I looked at the rest
  Who is this guy Busta? Who is this guy Snoop?
  Who is his other friend who's wearin the sky blue?
  Look at this pic here, he standing beside you
  Tell me his name now, I heard he was piru
  Confiscated the CD's at one of your homes
  For evidence ever since we heard some of your songs
  What about this Pimp guy, he was on one of your songs
  I coulda sworn that he said he had a "Pocket Full of Stones"
  Am I wrong?
Hell yeah! I don't know who that is~!
I don't know no Pimp C, all I know is I'm rich
And I'ma Bond like James, bet I be out here quick man
  You ain't gettin out of here, you must think that you're slick
  In the car we confiscated "The Chronic" and the +Clipse+
  "Diary" that you had and all your "Blueprints"
  On the Death Row booklet, we found your two prints
  Your thumb and your index, the judge will love this

[Chorus]

[Slick Rick - over Chorus]
It's a bloody murder!
It's a bloody murder!
It's a bloody murder!

[Chamillionaire]
Now you can see you're screwed as the evidence pours in
The witness to the crime was at three in the mornin
Gave us a description so we picked up your boy and
You'll get a lighter sentence if you put the crime on him

[Slick Rick]
A big celebrity, a case we long for
You a pirate - why you got that eyepatch on for?
Funny - puttin people in a hearse what I heard for
Where were you the night of April 21st son?
Home - I think you got your facts wrong, gat's on
You, Chamillionaire, Rob, Chuck, couple cats on Melview
What? - We gonna have to jail you too
In the lineup, don't speak until we tell you to
This the person who jimmed your lock, sir?
Well it's dark, kinda look like him, I'm not sure
Failiure to nail cause assailant's another (uh-huh)
Believe I see an unmarked tailin a brother
Hit the bodega, not no more game
This chick used to be nice actin all strange
Like she was gonna get it, pathetic
I sail in court, now they all apologetic

[Chorus]</pre>
