Artist: The Roots f/ Patty Crash
Album:  ...And Then You Shoot Your Cousin
Song:   Never
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Chorus: Patty Crash]
Street dreams, close your eyes
Say goodbye to my memory
Street dreams, this is the moment
The moment that feels like forever..
This is the end to where I began
And it feels like forever..
They say time flies, down from the sky
and says "Never...,"
I look down.. down.. all I see is never..
And all I know is all I know

[Black Thought]
I was born faceless in an oasis
Folks disappear here and leave no traces
No family ties nigga, no laces
Less than a full deck nigga, no aces
Waitin on Superman, losin all patience
Gettin wasted on an everyday basis
I'm stuck here, can't take a vacation
So fuck it, this shit is damnation
This is reality, mayne
Ain't no surprise I've been bangin without any mayne
What is this 'gotta be brave'
when into the night I'ma to go quietly mayne
Life is a bitch and then you live
until one day by death you're found
I tried to keep both of my feet on the ground
But I know my head is surrounded by clouds
Spirallin down, destined to drown
Forever is just a collection of nows
Off on my own, nowhere is my home
Approaching infinity's fork in the road
When I was young something I often was told
It's not a bargain if it costs you your soul
Costs you your pride, caution aside
I'm gone with the wind and along for the ride
Wish I could rest, and open my eyes
But time ain't finna fly down from the sky
A place where the lonely love
Not another soul's there, only us... (only us...)

[Chorus]

[Outro: Patty Crash]
I woke with a tear drop
All I know is what I know
I woke with a tear drop
All I know is what I know
It's all I know
All I know..</pre>
