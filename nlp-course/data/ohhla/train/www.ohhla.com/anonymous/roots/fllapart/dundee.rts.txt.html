Artist: The Roots
Album:  Things Fall Apart
Song:   100% Dundee
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

One one one one two
P-P-5-D
Yeah, yeah, P-P-5-D
I'm sayin, yo
Touch this yo, knahmsayin what? 
Yo-yo, yo, 100%..

[Black Thought]
Yo!  On these seventy-three keys, of ivory and ebony
I swear solemnly that I'll forever rock steadily
People wanna know where Malik?  He right next to me
The weaponry, the secret recipe
Hard to peep this, deep shit, shows I eat with
Contaminated thoughts I walk the street with
I bayonnet cassettes and chop beats with
this olympic lyricism you can't, compete with
Globe travellin, throwin your verse like a javelin
Things Fall Apart and MC's unravellin
Backstage whisperin to management like
"change the order, it's no way that we can rock after them"
My man sport the 'fro like _What's Happenin?_
From the latest hi-atus, The Roots back again
Your crew practicin to catch this natural blend
They packages read "care when handlin"
It's all soft shit, batteries not included with
Matter of fact, your whole front's a re-enactment
I blow your ba-tty ass into fragments, P-5-D
The new testament, mic specialist, what?

Yeah
Check it out, yo (3X)
Yo yo, Black Thought, I represent the Fifth Dynasty
Lyrical click, 100% Dundee

[Malik B]
Malik B, I represent the P-5-D
Guerilla click, 100% Dundee

The Milli-illitant-tant, 'pon cock, ready to rock
Power out, in the clout, it seems out, all through your block
Posse don't play the cut, but what, you get sheist
Got the personality named trife, ready to heist
Smashin 'graphs, snatch the ice, crush your mental device
Thought twice, shoulda thought once, got played for the dunce
Dialogues I moderate, cool out, we outta state
Just blendin in the great, give me room to ventilate
Most niggaz is fraudulent, the rap seargeant
Bargin, through your regiment, call your president
Hittin all targets cuz it's a cause that's lost
Between the killers when they probably Teddy Ruxpin talk
Droppin tears of steel, two drops up in the bucket
Facin three ? and a cop so yo fuck it
If I get abducted, trapped up in the belly
Wacked up my celly, get known like Dawn Stanley
You know the deally on the daily in the ?
If I sense you got a bend to your kite, then send it up
We press up on your corner with windows they're tinted up
Lay our props face down on the ground and get it up, what?
Face on the ground and get it up

[Black Thought]
Yo yo, Black Thought, I represent the Fifth Dynasty
Lyrical click, 100% Dundee

[Malik B]
Malik B, I represent the P-5-D
Guerilla click, 100% Dundee

[Black Thought]
Check it out
While you pose for pictures, I'm the invisible enigma
Down low, scope you off the roof like the fiddler
Cage you up in the vocal booth, you're held prisoner
Watch, while I'm bangin out this hot shit from Sigma
Illa-del-P-A, live without a DJ
And it's been that way, since Sergio Vallente
Yo, The Roots holdin it down, is all you can say
Plus the Black Thought em-cey, professional-lay
Push pen to paper like Chinua Achebe
Thumpin, what was your assumption
I lace your function, make it a Black Thought production
Word up I'm on somethin, stellar hold off course
I'm gone bluntin, travel light and broadcast
via satellite, Illa-Fifth Dynamite
Lyrically calculus in this arithametic hip-hop metropolis
But loyal fiends coppin this hot shit
Yaknahmsayin?  Hot shit, word up
Illa-Fifth hot shit y'all

Black Thought, I represent the Fifth Dynasty
Lyrical click, 100% Dundee
