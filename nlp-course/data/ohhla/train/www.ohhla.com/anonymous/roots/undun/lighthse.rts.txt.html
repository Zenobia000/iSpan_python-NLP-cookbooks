[Intro: Dice Raw]
If you can't swizz-im then you're bound to drizz-own
Passin out life jackets, 'bout to go di-down
Get down with the captain or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss I'ma hit you wit this 
Yo, if you can't swizz-im then you're bound to dri-down
Passin out life jackets, 'bout to go di-down
Get down with the captain or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss I'ma hit you wit, this 
 
[Chorus: Dice Raw]
And no one's in the lighthouse 
You're face down in the ocean!
And no one's in the lighthouse 
and it seems like you just screamed 
It's no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there's no one there 
that cares if you drown (Face down in the ocean!)
 
[Dice Raw]
Smokin cheap weed, sippin on cheap vodka
You pick your poison down Davey Jones' locker
It's rum we be wantin by the tons my consumption
Take a look at my lungs and my liver, it's disgustin
Take a look at the man in the mirror, we start fussin
Only one person gets hurt when throwin the punches: Me
And the man behind the glass just laughs
The waves come over my head and just crash
My hand start bleeding, water starts receedin
A feeling comes into my heart I start believin that..
I actually might survive through the evening
Survive on my own thoughts of suicide that's competin
with thoughts of tryna stay alive, which been weakened
by the feelin of putting on a smile while being beaten
The fear of drowning, still divin in the deep end
The waters carried me so far you can't reach 'em
Man, it feels like there's no one...
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Black Thought] 
...After the love is lost 
Friendship dissolves and even blood is lost 
Where did it begin? The way we did each other wrong
Troubled water neither one of us could swim across
I stopped holdin my breath, now am I better off?
There without a trace and you in my head and all
the halted motion of a rebel without a pause
What it do is done, 'til you are dead and gone
The Grim Reaper tellin me to swim deeper
Where the people go to lo and behold, the soul keeper
I'm not even breakin out in a sweat, or cold fever but
I'm never payin up on my debt, or tolls either
I'll leave the memories here, I won't need 'em
If I, stop thinking and lie, now that's freedom
Your body's part of the Maritime Museum
and  face down in the past is where I'm bein
 
[Chorus]
 
[Outro: Dice Raw]
If you can't swizz-im then you're bound to drizz-own
Passin out life jackets, 'bout to go di-down
Get down with the captain or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss I'ma hit you wit this 
Yo, if you can't swizz-im then you're bound to dri-down
Passin out life jackets, 'bout to go di-down
Get down with the captain or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss I'ma hit you wit, this</pre>
