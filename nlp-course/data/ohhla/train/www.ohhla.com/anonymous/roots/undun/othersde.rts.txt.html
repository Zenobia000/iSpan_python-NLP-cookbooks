[Black Thought]
Yo, we obviously need to tone it down a bit
Runnin 'round town spendin time like it's counterfeit
Everybody catchin hay fever like sinuses
Step in my arena let me show y'all who the highness is
You might say I could be doing somethin positive
Humbled head down low and broke like promises
Soakin and broken in a joke like comics is
Not enough paper to be payin folks compliments
But when that paper got low, so did my tolerance
And it ain't no TRUTH in a dare, without the consequence
Listen if it not for these hood inventions
I'd just be another kid from the block with no intentions
On the dock of that bay, serving a life sentence
Even if I'm goin to HELL, I'm gonna make an entrance
Yeah~! Let 'em know I'm gettin cheese like omletes is
but I'm the toast of the town like Thomas is
 
[Chorus: Bilal Oliver] 
We're all on a journey 
Down the hall of memories
Don't worry 'bout what you ain't got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved MO'
But when I make it to the other side 
(Make it to the other side)
That's when we'll settle up the score
 
[Black Thought]
Yo, we did this in remembrance of 
faces from the past, we no longer have an image of
Carryin cold-blooded hearts, that never been for love
Brothers keep goin for theirs but never get enough
World travelers that seen it all and did enough
Only to return to learn the world wasn't big enough
Damn, how long has it been? I guess the jig is up
Now all I know is I'm about to wake this nigga up
Yeah, that hindsight 20/20 
Now niggaz dead on the money, try to take something from me
It's a wrap like mummy, undun I am becoming and
When he's tired of runnin, through the layers of the onion
He'll probably shed a tear, 'cause there'll be no more fast times
Just his weak mind scrolled out like a bad sign
He never had enough and got confused when they asked why
Life is only a moment in time and it passed by
 
[Chorus]
 
[Greg Porn] 
I'm sitting on top of the world ready to jump off
Thinkin of various ways to breakin the law
Thinkin that enough is enough, but still I want more
Thinkin of how I'm playin with fire tht burned my young boy
By any means necessary, don't give a damn
So every night I'm on a flight that never lands
Be an asshole when the shit hits the fan
pr bet your life, on a bluff and a bad hand
Can't win, can't lose, get 'em gassed 
Leave 'em leakin fuel, either way the market moves
Cash rules kings, queens, prince and princess
Every night I'm crossin a line that ain't the finish
Every thought is dark as a glass of fuckin Guinness
To far gone to come back to my senses
Now I'm on the edge of my bed makin love to my meds
Every moments like a pistol to my head when I'm gettin mine
 
[Chorus]</pre>
