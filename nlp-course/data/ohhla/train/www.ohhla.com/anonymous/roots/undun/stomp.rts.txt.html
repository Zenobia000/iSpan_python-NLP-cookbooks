[Intro]
"It's about flesh and blood
 It's about a heartbeat that beats, strong
 It's about passion, that's unyielding
 And I want you men to know today: it is your time
 It is your HOUR, it is your moment
 Go take it!"
 
[Black Thought] 
Yeah, speakin of pieces of a man
Starin at a future in the creases of my hand
It reads like a final letter, I'm leavin for my fam 
but it's written, in language they will never understand
A late repentant, never deviatin from a plan
I drive by, headed for the Valley of the Damned
The Wheels spin, I'm lookin for a sacrificial lamb
then roll tactics like a soldier out in the Sudan
Listen, was this a matter of flesh and blood? Yes it was
Does it matter who win and lose? Yes it does
It ain't about the most blessed love
When you return to the essence, what is it back to the essence of?
Greatness I wasn't in the prescence of
'cause you was fake and never measured up
You just a nigga on his regular, but how far am I ahead of ya?
It just as easily coulda been me instead of ya
 
[interlude]  
"We gon' fight 'til we don't fight no more
 and when we can't fight no more, we gon' lie down
 and BLEED a while, we gon' get UP, and fight some more
 Now I want y'all to say it with me
 Repeat after me when I say it, y'all:
 WE GON' FIGHT~!"
 
[Greg Porn]
Fuck gettin fuck, Immaculate Conception
Now what's beef ain't even a question
Calico kisses, cold blood and crime tape
Flirt with death, every night it's a blind date
One night stand payback's a bitch
She'll have you skinny dippin in a pool of your piss
Blood sweat and tears, broken teeth and spit
Put the barrel in your mouth, blow the devil a kiss
Put the knife in ya back, cut down to the red meat
Daddy should've let me be a stain on the bed sheets
I'm one shot short of a Molotov cocktail
Kick in the door like welcome to my world
I'm an evil genius when it comes to this dumb shit
Half of the time I'ma keep it one hundred
Don't play chicken when I'm drivin them crazy
Get hit in the wing, thigh, breast or drumstick, we like...</pre>
