Artist: The Roots 
Album:  Do You Want More?!!!??! 
Song:   Silent Treatment 
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X

Girl you know that you need
to stop givin' me the silent.. treatment baby 
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I wanna love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me 
And treating me silently 
 
Verse One: BlackThought

Yo, I had a Queen named Amina, height 5'7" 
Caramel-complected, body like heaven 
Met her through the sister of my man Big Vince 
Like some shit from out the flicks we been in love ever since 
She called me her chocolate brotha, I call her my sugar sista 
Knew Shorty could work it since before I ever kissed her
I never dissed her, painted my picture to hit 
But because sex she wasn't with, she started flippin an' shit 
Like, "Listen man, I'm Queen Amina, Amina's not no freak and 
that game is weak and keep tryin to hit I could quit speakin 
Tariq in fact, you bein BlackThought don't get ya closer
I dig ya but won't bone ya because I'm so-called supposed ta 
Most o' them would, but that couldn't be me, that's not my flava 
Go home and think about that, maybe later on I'll page ya..."
I contemplated, and then concluded she was bluffin
Steady pursuin screwin, gettin nothin but the silent treatment 

Chorus (+ "Silently bay-bee" at end)

Verse Two: BlackThought

Crazy frustration, about my lovin situation 
When patience was a virtue, but I wasn't used to waitin
I want some Marvin Gaye healin, feelin is real inside 
I slip and slide, my ride'll keep you occupied, I'd..
love to get wit it like that, but my baby's kitty cat's capped
and locked, Love Boat is docked at the shore 
And what for?  Later for groupies on tour 
Why won't my sugar call me no more?
I mean, my Queen gets upset, rejectin and sexually neglect 
Then sayin I'm more sewer than Das EFX, and closed-minded
It's like I'm blinded by the skinnin
I'm into women; because of that, this one's into communication 
Temptation played the vandal, freakin my brain, my mind 
Rippin the handle on physically scandalous acts
Yo!  She knew what I wanted, but she fronted 
... bust it

Chorus
  
Verse Three: BlackThought

Well umm
Movin right along with the song, plus the strong 
feelings on my mind, desire to intertwine
Combine and blend, baby bust a message that I send
Ain't no need to pretend, cause shit is real til the end 
I provide a place to hide from crime, hard times
and livin trife, while I open ya mind, you're in my life 
like love, it ain't no way no one can rise above what's real
That's why I'm feelin like you're makin me bugged
I puff an El on fifty deuce while I walk in the rain 
Heart feelin killa pain while I hop the train 
Dial her number to the rest, and ain't no messages left 
Regardless, my chest thumps from stress, yo it's a mess 
I don't know what I got to do to make you understand 
I'm for real and that's no question, no frontin or no guessin
Undressin, carressin, in the span, that I contain in my hand 
could touch and make you say that I'm such a man 
and call my name, so let me set your body aflame 
I'll never treat you like a dame or run game 
Now who's to blame?
I know you're not a hoe for niggaz with a lot of dough 
But I just wanted you to know 

Chorus (+ "silently" at end)

Chorus 1/2 (+ "silently, si-lent-ly" at end)
