Artist: The Roots
Album:  Do You Want More?!!!??!
Song:   What Goes On Pt. 7
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Do you wanna know.. what goes on? *2X*
	(Tell me baby!)
Do you wanna know.. what goes on? *2X*
	(Tell me baby!)

[Black Thought]
Yo, niggaz can not see me, can not be me or
capture the metaphoric phrase blasted off stage when I tour
I am but a messanger born to blow up
My niggaz knew it all the time, lyrically I was a dime
At the age of nine, shorty Black, could rhyme
On the mic I never wasted time, I'm, the exquisite wizard
when I visit shorties I hit it I'm cool as a blizzard
Nigga what? You want, I'll bust your fronts, with the butt of my
black paper chase ya and then erase ya rhyme
Sucker, MC's how I hate it when you waste your time
My state of mind, shine like it's diamond studded
I rhyme budded on stage, word is bond, when I'm on, I rage
Got the 12 gauge at the rest so play, and into rest you lay
My everyday M.O. is gettin dough cause times is rougher
than a mother for brothers to scuffle shuffle your cards kid
Cause the odds is, niggaz'll hustle and live, foul
This wild environment hostile produce, the music in me
So my style's the blend of what is and was
You could get a buzz from it, but enter too deep
and reach a summit you fall and then plummit beyond real
Where you're killed if your raps ain't ill
Another crab motherfucker 'nother cap to peel
Through these amps, I motivate camps to dance
Niggaz too advanced, I warn, I'm just tellin you what goes on

Do you wanna know.. what goes on? *2X*
	(Tell me baby!)
Do you wanna know.. what goes on? *2X*
	(Tell me baby!)

[Myself aka ELO the Cosmic Eye]
Inside my head, you wish to see
The signs appear, the shit's not clear
What if I flipped, would you know how to maintain your edge
I'm takin heads because, there's no fuckin ledge
I pledge allegiance to my cosmic guide
I couldn't fit in three dimensions if I tried
Civilizations I can delete, so crews don't bother me
Battle with Jehovah gaining universal soveirgnty
Niggaz run around like clones, I got planets and thrones
Throughout the galaxy my name's well known (my name's well known)
I'm all alone in my zone, you wouldn't understand
Stare in my face, fuck around and catch a scar man
(Malik B)

[Malik B]
Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So when we begin to assassinate your cast members
they shall hinder, wavin white flags, man we surrender
Those half-assed negroes know they're no contenders
In syringes, I can shoot up lyrical vengeance
And my grammar, might do a mandatory life in slammers
You should regret it, thinkin about steppin to me
niggaz forget it - you'll get gassed with lyrics leaded
Most energetic, I never snag I'm tightly threaded
I flip scripts like pattern twistness in calisthetics
Black Thought, Elo and me a trio
Tellin the the strong, word is bond
I'm just tellin you what goes on

Do you wanna know.. what goes on? *2X*
	(Tell me baby!)
Do you wanna know.. what goes on? *2X*
	(Tell me baby!)

Do you wanna know.. what goes on? *2X*
	(C'mon brother)
Do you wanna know.. what goes on? *2X*
	(Tell me baby!)</pre>
