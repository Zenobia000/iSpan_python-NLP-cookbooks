Artist: The Roots
Album:  Do You Want More?!!??!
Song:   Proceed
Typed by: OHHLA.com

Just think, what if you could just, just blink yourself away?
Just think, what if you could just, just blink yourself away?
Jeff X can rock the mic with tooth decay
I be the 5 foot 7, residing at the mecca lesson south section
Used to cut class in the infinite pursuit of ass
Back in eighty-seven
Easy with the chics I was a chocolate boy
Raised in the cellar with the rhythm like Ella
Walking down the streets to the subway where i lay
Til the train stop then a nigga hop
Used to do the pop dance to the planet rock
At the block party everybody jocked [who me?]
It's the MC sucka niggaz envy
I got my contract in 1993 and 
I shall proceed

Chorus: repeat 2X

I shall, proceed
And continue, to rock the mic

Verse Two:

I wake up early in the morning, I mean early afternoon
Break a lyrical hymn of the stem like boom
I'm flyer when I'm higher put my shit up on a tomb
That nigga represented on the 28th of June
I'm representing philly on the 28th of June
I can make you feel that i'm a surreal cartoon
with my pistol in the face of hip hop, stick in your face
Because i'm on a paper chase, yes i'm on a paper chase
My Timberlands are fully laced I be the Mr. Boogeyman 
With records from 125th to Japan
I laid them play like Johnny Hathaway and shake a hand, shake a hand
Your lady tried to kick it, but I couldn't play my man
My niggaz is my niggaz ya see she didn't understand
I shake your hand and shit'll hit the fan, just think
Just think, what?  What if you could, just blink, what?
Just blink yourself away?

Chorus

Verse Three:

Malik B get on the mic yo there's too much on my mind [say what?]
Malik get on the mic, there's too much on my mind
Johnny on the spot, got the rhythm and the rhyme
Fuckin with The Roots you know them niggaz is the dime
I can make a hundred yard line start to dash
I can make a whole lake of fish start to splash
I can make Conan and the Titans clash
I can Metallica and guns 'N Roses crash
Used to smash crash parties like i was disturbed
Used to make plots against the herringbone herb
But now, all I do disperse the verb
And like a nerd i can make you say, "He's superb"
Word is perfect, never ever shall you misinterpret
I move styles like bowels so now you know i'm worth it
Direct from Philly, the lands where niggas scheme
So you know I got the sheen in my gleam

Chorus
