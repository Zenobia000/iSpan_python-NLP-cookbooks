Intro (Nas)
Yeahhhhh I'ma do it from back hereee
What up Braveheart? what it taste like daddy? (chocolate cake nigga)
Yeah that's what I'm talking about that's how it's supposed to be
Life is beautiful
Yo this girl tried to play me thow .. so I had to ya know ..
I had to do my thing to step it up
Get right with a new one ..
Now I'm feeling alright so everythings all good

[Chorus: Jully Black]
(It's alrightttttt)
Nothing ever gonna nothings ever gonna come between me and you
Baby I just got to let you know (Knowwww)
Nothing ever gonna nothings ever gonna come between me and you
I promise you the sun moon and stars

[Verse 1: Jungle]
We used to meet at the motel
Heart break hotel
Body hypnotic exotic as hell
Got a nigga in a spell
She from my dreams
Girl taste good like carvelle ice cream
A few tatoo's on her butter soft skin
I gave my support when she had that abortion
Remember I could make you warm in the winter
Buy you a mink coat every december
And laugh and joke about the shit we been threw
Then you open your legs and say be gentle
I'll try I can see they spark in your eyes
It's gonna be fireworks like the fourth of july
Untouchable, unbreakable, intimate, multiple orgasms .. when I be rippin it
Your favorite positions, neighbours be listening, hating and wishing that
our relationship end
But you my brave girl

[Chorus: Jully Black]

[Verse 2: Wiz]
Now let me tell you what I am here to do
My baby girl is stuck stupid looking misserable ma keep your head up
Cause ma I'm right here let's do the damn thing girl it can't be love
Cause I be waiting a minute for your walk by
Listen I'm lifting your legs up in the air my only vision
While I'm stroking thinking about money and smoking
Hoping we could do this again and again and again and again yo
I feel your pain I'm leaving your mouth dry your man can't do this ma he to lame
Keep him of your brain
While you let me do me on you drove off as soon as I came
It was evident shorty talking celebent never this I am not reverend do you
hear what I'm telling you
The time is now or never shortyyy screaming and yelling
Yo calm down and let my comrad tell it

[Verse 3: Nas - singing]
Girl you look so sweet (so sweet girl)
But that is what you are (what you are baby)
And no one comes between (nobody)
Never some moon and stars (that's right)
Some come sail away with me (me and you)
Cause your my Braveheart girl (Bravehearts)
And will get high with each other uh huh (uh huh)

[Nas - rapping]
Phase one we meet and exchange numbers
Phase two is day two call you for a adress to come to
Day three is phase three h-e-a-d usually
But cause we just met there is other interests
Want to smuther with teady bears and lilly's
Wine and dine you I'm a gentleman but savage behind you
Know you feeling me my carrots will blind you
You love me but I love liquir and bud I married tijuana

[Chorus]
