Artist: Guru
Album:  Baldhead Slick & Da Click
Song:   Where's Our Money?
Typed by: bootleg210@msn.com

[Guru talking]
Yeah, heh-heh, it's time y'all..
It's yours truly in the house, you know me
Baldhead Slick, that's right
That nigga who been puttin it down for years
Spittin fire
That's right, holdin it down in the streets
Fuck the industry bullshit
Switchin up from sweatsuits and kicks, to gators and slacks
Spittin nothin but pure facts,
Plus I got my clip with me this time
and we aimin at your head punk
Ill Kid Records, New Milliennium duckets
Snatchin the cheese from right under you rats noses

{*samples*}
(Ladies and gentlemen!)
   "You know and I know, I might drop a verse"
   "When the mic's within my reach, I don't mean to preach"
   "When the mic's within my reach..."
(Ladies and gentlemen!)
   "When the mic's within my reach"  "I'm nice like that"

[Guru]
Don't base my whole life on loot, but money sure helps
I keep it tight like army boots, to ensure wealth
I meet suckers everyday that rhyme, they say they rhyme
Most of them, corny as hell, won't get paid a dime
Alotta these punks, they all sound the same
They all sound lame, fakin like they down with the game
Against me they'll fail, I'm like the black Frankie Hale
I leave 'em slumped, and they body dumped over the rail
Show me respect, then cut me a fat check
You little niggaz are like virgins, you haven't had ass yet
Wet behind the ears while I been spittin darts for years
Don't make me embarass you in front of your so-called peers
Them fools gassed you in the first place, dirtface
Cocksucker thought you had wins got suck in the worst place
And that's when I, attack your fears
Cuz I'm a real racketeer, get my money and bring it back here

[Chorus]
It's me little homey, Gangsta B
Head Slick poppin off and it's thanks to me
Have the check in the mail to the bank for me
Flagrant chief, cuz that's how my behavior be
It's me gettin stocks and bonds, runnin with lots of dons
Don't buy the chain if you can't cop the charm
Me and my peeps carry lots of arms
Where's our money? Where's our money?

{*samples*}
(Ladies and gentlemen!)
   "You know and I know, I might drop a verse"
   "When the mic's within my reach, I don't mean to preach"
   "When the mic's within my reach..."
(Ladies and gentlemen!)
   "When the mic's within my reach"  "I'm nice like that"

[Guru]
For the dough, I'll lay you out with no remorse
You'll get tossed, legs and limbs lost, just for tryna floss
I don't give a fuck if you think you're the man
You think I give a damn? You better think of a plan
I come through, like gangbusters to bang and crush ya
Cuz the fake cats that you hang with are suckas
One phone call, death to you all
Picture me scuffin up my new kicks or shoes in a brawl
Any problem with the law, I'll beat the case for real
Beat you in the face with steel, leave you so you can't taste or feel
For the cash, I'll take you out and your whole staff
Have you lookin funny as hell, but I won't laugh
It's gettin overcrowded in this rap game, so I slap lames
Who kick phony lip, with their wack names
I'm so and so, I'm this and that
You get dissed and smacked, while I counterfeit your stacks

[Chorus]

{*samples*}

   "You know and I know, I might drop a verse"

   "When the mic's within my reach..."
