[talking]
Whattup whattup whattup, I got them 5 dolla Baldhead Slick CD's
whattup whatttup come and get 'em
Yo come here, come here man (yo)
Didn't {*slapping*} didn't I say {*slapping*}
Didn't I tell you not to come around here with that shit
Huh?! Get down!

[Guru]
Yo I keep my enemies close, now I'm ready to squeeze
Watch 'em all cry, and make 'em get on they knees
  "Cry... cry..." - "I want you to cry!"
  "Yes I want you to get on your knees and cry!"
Get on your knees and cry, you know the reason why
You ungrateful motherfucker, can't believe you lied
You tried to fake me, snake me cuz my heart is good
I knew you would, you played the role as hard as you could
Revenge is my ammo - black whip, tinted windows
Relentless is my wrath, we in the mix like chemicals
Why I'm actin that way? Cuz this ain't back in the days
Still hold a grudge, old man thug about to blast you away
I'll straggle ya plot, effortlessly, with one thought
This is way past guntalk, so many blocks I done rocked
You didn't know that I was thorough, did you?
5 Boroughs of crews, I'm bout to bury you dudes

{*samples*} [4x]
"Cry..." - "I want you to cry!"
"Yes I want you to get on your knees and cry!"

[Guru]
Yo, look me in the eye, and explain to me why
That I should let things slide, we used to be on the same side
Now it's all twisted, and we no longer kick it
You had your chance to advance with me bitch, you missed it
It's too late to beg or plead, too late for apologies
Stop leavin messages, word stop calling me
See I got a nice little treat for you
I'ma make it crazy tough in these streets for you
I don't wanna hear nothin, cuz I called your bluff
You call yourself buck, my click'll flip and fuck you up
Punks that don't know me think I'm mellow and calm
But my peeps they know, I'm wild, gully, and slightly gone
Yo stupid, you bout to catch the whole can of this
Whoop ass, you shook fast, you shit your pants on this
I'm never losin mine, I don't feel like doin time
But I still ain't gonna have nobody foolin with mine

{*samples*} [4x]
"Cry..." - "I want you to cry!"
"Yes I want you to get on your knees and cry!"

[Guru]
Anger management -- yeah I probably need that
You feelin my feedback, just stay down on your knees cat
You quiet, that's cuz you afraid of dying
Afraid of losin yo' head when my lead start flying
You can't be serious, try to fuck with my career in this
100 soldiers every city, you suckers can't come near Da Click
I don't even got the time for the likes of you
So what I'd like to do, is finish with those like you
Just for schemin, boy you coulda made it, but you hated
So now you gon' find out that the pain is excrutiating
So fuck what you be sayin, cuz nobody heard
This is a dirty game, I'm takin all your chips, that's my word

{*samples*} [4x]
"Cry..." - "I want you to cry!"
"Yes I want you to get on your knees and cry!"

"Yo I keep my enemies close, now I'm ready to squeeze
Watch 'em all cry, and make 'em get on they knees"
"Yo I keep my enemies close, now I'm ready to squeeze
Watch 'em all cry, and make 'em get on they knees..."</pre>
