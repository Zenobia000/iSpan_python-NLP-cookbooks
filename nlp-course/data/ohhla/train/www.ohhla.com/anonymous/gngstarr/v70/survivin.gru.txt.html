Album:  Version 7.0 The Street Scriptures
Song:   Surviving Tha Game
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus: sped up samples of "Live and Let Die"]
When you were young and your heart, was an open book
You used to say live and let live
You know you did, you know you did, you know you did

[Guru]
You know you said that shit, but now it's dead that shit
You 'bout ready to pop a dome, you wanna get that kid
Growin up they always told you to be nice
But when the beef jumps off you like "This can't be right"
("You live and let die") And that ain't all, cause now you got issues
It's like two or three ratchets that you always carry wit'chu
Just in case you see them boys you don't like
Now you got drama, but your momma told you don't fight
("You live and let die") It ain't much choice when they violate first
Heh~! You gotta lay 'em down although your face in the dirt
How the fuck did this shit get so out of hand?
You better think of somethin, you won't survive without a plan
("You live and let die") Welcome to the underworld of criminal enterprise
Where if shit gets critical, they'll let you fry
Will you turn the other cheek, or will you let your burners speak?
Ain't it amazing all these things you gotta learn in these streets?

[Chorus]

[Guru]
I used to think that shit, when I think back kid
But now it's "Live and Let Die" so you can bring that shit
Yeah, and I'ma be the one to dispose of you
Have your closest peeps tellin you, it's over dukes
("You live and let die") I'm sober dukes, I don't drink no more
So I'ma watch you pop shit and watch you sink to the floor
The brainbender, mindstretcher, fate sealer
I can't stand disloyalty, you know I hate squealers
("You live and let die") How 'bout I introduce you to the face peeler?
Fuck a doctor! Son you gonna need a faith healer
As a citizen, in this society we're livin in
Niggaz violate my rights, then I gotta get rid of 'em
("You live and let die") The laws of survival, warfare and nature
The reason why your wig gets pushed back a few layers
I'm so serious, and you won't know what hit'cha
That's the way I see it, that's what it says in my +Scripture+

[Outro: sped up "Live and Let Die" samples]
But if this ever changing world in which we live in
makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die...
You live and let die</pre>
