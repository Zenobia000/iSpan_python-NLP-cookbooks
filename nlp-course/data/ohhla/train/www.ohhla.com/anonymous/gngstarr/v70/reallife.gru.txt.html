Artist: Guru f/ B-Real (Cypress Hill)
Album:  Version 7.0 The Street Scriptures
Song:   Real Life
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro: Guru]
7 Grand
I'm up in here, it's your man Guru
My man B-Real, uh
Solar
Yo

[Guru]
Blazin up a L in my hotel suite
While niggaz sellin beef like it's wholesale meat
I wanna see millions and help the whole town eat
Pull off an industry caper, watch it go down sweet
I'm your leader, so you gotta do what I decide
A lot of motherfuckers have wished for my demise
Took a trip out West, to where the riders ride
Up in the spot, with the O.G.'s on either side
I get love, so y'all don't wanna push the issue
'less you wanna feel the steel gettin pushed against you
'less you wanna see the barrel gettin put to your temple
Get the message? Slow your role, that should be simple
Y'all don't understand that I'm a man of honor
All it takes is a nod, then my fam is on ya
Your man was poppin shit, now your mans a goner
This is real talk from New York to California

[Chorus: B-Real]
When you want it +Real+ I'ma let it +B+ known
That everything ain't what you think it is unless I roam
Cause this is real life, real life
Heard me? Real life, real life
When you need it +Real+ I'ma let it +B+ known
That everything ain't what you think it is unless I roam
Cause this is real life, real life
Ya heard me? Real life, real life - ya heard me?

[B-Real]
B-Real and Guru, who woulda thought?
The two on the same mics and we blowin the spot
Seen the game change wow what a metamorphosis
Weak emcees better thank the Lord for this
Cause these days rap skills don't pay bills
But image'll sell yo' punk ass one or two mill'
Gold in the grill and mo' quests to steal
Show a little steel and scream that you keep it real
So many colors in the {?} that'll hit you with paint
We know the ones who say "keep it real" are the ones who ain't
They say they got it poppin, but they're broke as fuck
But on their video, they always got dough like fuck
In reality, they don't have dough like that~!
And their live show, they don't even flow like that
I'm tired of dem, tired of me, tired of bein tired
Fuck it, you know what? We're all fired!

[Chorus]</pre>
