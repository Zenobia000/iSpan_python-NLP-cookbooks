Artist: Guru f/ Jaguar Wright
Album:  The Street Scriptures 7.0
Song:   Talk to me
Typed by: SCRcustoms@aol.com

[Chorus – Jaguar Wright]
I really want to talk to you 
But I'm afraid
Don't know what you'll say

I really want to talk to you
But I'm afraid
That you'll walk away

[Guru]
No Ma I'm not that dude, I'm really not that rude
I wouldn't dis you or dismiss you cause its not that cool
Wont blind you with that bling, We can get the same
You know a movie could be cool see I like simple things
I see you lookin at me, you see me lookin back
Your creepy eyes and your tight frame thats what I'm lookin at
Cool you can talk to me, don't need to shy away
Lets break the ice and make it right, don't even got to wait

[Chorus – Jaguar Wright]
I really want to talk to you 
But I'm afraid
Don't know what you'll say

I really want to talk to you
But I'm afraid
That you'll walk away

[Guru]
Yeah Ma I know your nervous Holding your thoughts inside
You got my full attention, now that you caught my eye
Think we can get it poppin, that's if you just relax
Don't do this very often, you think I'm just a Mac
And that ain't even me, I'm on a different page
These days I'm crazy focused, I'm at a different stage
Give me some conversation, some mental stimulation
I'm being extra patient, see girl you got me waitin

[Chorus – Jaguar Wright]
I really want to talk to you 
But I'm afraid
Don't know what you'll say

I really want to talk to you
But I'm afraid
That you'll walk away

[Guru]
You think I'm gonna play you, Baby just keep it true
You don't know what I'm thinking, might wanna be with you
And even if we talk, but we don't click like that
We can stay in touch, cause I don't trip like that
Still got to tuck that banger, this life theres lots of stress
You help to ease the strain, ease the pain you hot to death
So why you standing there, and I'm way over here
Can you come closer, How am I supposed to 
Get to know you dear

[Chorus – Jaguar Wright]
I really want to talk to you 
But I'm afraid
Don't know what you'll say

I really want to talk to you
But I'm afraid
That you'll walk away

[Jaguar Wright]
I'm telling you you're wonderful
And I'm really digging you
Baby 
I wish that I wann see you
I wanna get to know you , baby
I wanna talk to you
But Im afraid 
Don't know what your gonna say
I really want to talk to you
Please don't walk away
