Artist: Gangstarr
Album:  Step in the Arena
Song:   Who's Gonna Take the Weight
                                      
   Intro
   
   "Knowledge is power, and knowledge can be the difference between life
   or death...you should know the truth and the truth shall set you
   free."
   
   Verse 1
   
   I was raised like a Muslim
   Prayin' to the East
   Nature of my life relates rhymes I release
   like a cannon
   Cuz I been plannin' to be rammin' what I wrote
   straight on a plate down your throat
   So digest as I suggest we take a good look
   At who's who while I'm readin' from my good book
   And let's dig into every nook and every cranny
   Set your mind free as I slam these thoughts
   And just like a jammy goes pow [FX: Gunshots]
   You're gonna see what I'm sayin' now
   You can't be sleepin'
   cuz things are gettin' crazy
   You better stop being lazy
   There's many people frontin'
   And many brothers droppin'
   All because of dumb things, let me tell you somethin'
   I've been through so much that I'm such
   a maniac, but I still act out of faith
   that we can get the shit together so I break
   on fools with no rhymes skills messin' up the flow
   And people with no sense who be movin' much too slow
   And so, you will know the meaning of the Gang Starr
   Guru with the mic and Premier raise the anchor
   swiftly, as we embark on a journey
   I had to get an attorney
   I needed someone to defend my position
   Decisions I made, cuz now it's time to get paid
   And ladies, these rhymes are like the keys to a dope car
   Maybe a Lexus or a Jaguar
   Still, all of that is just material
   So won't you dig the scenario
   And just imagine if each one is teachin' one
   We'll come together so that we become
   A strong force, then we can stay on course
   Find your direction through introspection
   And for my people out there I got a question
   Can we be the sole controllers of our fate?
   Now who's gonna take the weight?
   
   Verse 2
   
   The weight of the world is heavy on my mind
   So as my feelings unwind I find
   That some try to be down just cuz it's trendy
   Others fall victim to envy
   But I'll take the road less travelled
   So I can see all my hopes and my dreams unravel
   Relievin' your stress, expressin' my interest
   In the situation that you're facin'
   That's why I'm down with the Nation
   Spirituality supports reality
   We gotta fight with the right mentality
   So we can gain what is rightfully ours
   This is the meaning of the chain and the star
   Land is power, so gimme forty acres
   Let's see how far I can take ya
   Original invincible
   That's how I'm lookin' at it
   I use my rhymes like a Glock automatic
   Any means necessary, I'm goin' all out
   Before the rains bring the nuclear fallout
   So let me ask you, is it too late?
   Ayo, who's gonna take the weight?
