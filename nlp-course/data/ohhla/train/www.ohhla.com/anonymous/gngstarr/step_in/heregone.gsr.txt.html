Artist: Gangstarr
Album:  Step in the Arena
Song:   Here Today, Gone Tomorrow

Many MC's are mislead
Mislead by the lies that they pump in their heads
The money and the fame that they're hoping to find
Will never come close to the scope of my rhyme
Now some have been succesful but really
And yo, these MC's are clearly not nearly
Up to this level or should I say caliber
Because I'm hype that the company's selling me
Because they'll take a dud, talk some crud and then push him
But in the next year, someone new will just squoosh him
Because when you sell out to appeal to the masses
You have to go back and enroll in some classes
So cash in your check 'cause it's the last one you get
The tables have turn and now you ain't in effect
So jet to the rear and you better just follow
'Cause what's here today maybe gone tomorrow

Here and gone in a flash, some made cash
While other suckers go broke real fast
Some never make any money but still they act funny
LIke they're thinking they're running
Things, wearing rings and medallions
Then listen to their rhymes when we rather take valiums
'Cause swiftness and skills they are lacking
So I send them packing, they should have know not to tax in
And smashing all of the vocals to smithereens
Watching them collecting themselves 'cause they ?(bitter seen)?
But some find happiness while others find sorrow
And what's here today, maybe gone tomorrow
