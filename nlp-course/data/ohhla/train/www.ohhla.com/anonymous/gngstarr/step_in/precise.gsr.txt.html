Artist: GangStarr
Album:  Step in the Arena
Song:   Precisely the Right Rhymes

[Guru]
My subject matter and context are blessed
Vocal inflection connects, it's a slugfest
Ladies approach to hear quotes from the spokesman
Thoughts are like oceans for my lyrics to float in
I'm absolutely astute so salute
You try to be cute, and you get tossed like a crap shoot
Don't misinterpret or slander
Just get with the words and the way I command ya
Cause you're in the right place, and luckily it's the right time
And since I'm inclined, I'll kick precisely the right rhymes

(Premier cuts and scratches "to kick the right rhyme")

[Guru]
Listen listen listen I'll tell ya
My rhymes are like shelter, or rather like an umbrella
Protecting you from the weak stuff you heard from those creampuffs
about the schemes that they dreamed of
About the way they slayed this one or that one
but won't step to me, cause they know the last one
who tried to match the panache of the Guru
received a curse that was much worse than voodoo
Cause the effect of my voice is immense
It would make more sense if suckers hide in the basement
But yo I don't look for hassles, my rhymes are like castles
I got much flavor and class too
I know you've notice I'm a writer of hype lines
Because I'm inclined, to kick precisely the right rhymes

(Premier cuts and scratches "to kick the right rhyme")

[Guru]
Precisely the right rhymes, simplistic but packed
with power and punch, and yo you might want to step back
But stay close as your host serves hors d'oeveurs
Satisfying your cravings, and calming your nerves
See I have an interest, in giving you more than the next man
Cause my style is pure and
if you are sane and remain in your right mind
You'll see I'm inclined, to kick precisely the right rhymes
