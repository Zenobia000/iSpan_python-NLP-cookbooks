[Guru]
Take your time, recline and make your mind up
I feel fine, so I'm gonna wind up
Here's the pitch, check the switch, now watch me
hit you right to this, while I pursue this
desire, to get you, on up to step to
rhythms and rhymes, cause I respect you
Unless you're a biting one, a non-writing one
Reciting some of my lines, although you are blind
you'll see my shadow, rather my silhouette
But I'll be glad though, knowin your pillow's wet
And that you're upset, cause you thought you brought
the answer -- to this dilemma in rap but I'll vamp you with

[Damo D-Ski]
Pure is my thought, my spirit is my heart
I shall embark to spark my fine art
of oratory wisdom, emcees I quiz them
on terms and techniques, then I'll wreck each with speech
I win the science fair, so you don't you try and scare
me with your threats and, idle atrocities
I am the best and yo I am your boss at these
methods and forms of, causin swarms of fans
just to dance, like thunder storms of
what it must take to, crush you or break you
If I dislike you, I may not hate you
It's just that you sound weak when, you think you're speakin

[Guru]
The rhymes are peaceful like yoga, and yo I know the
time must be mine, so I'm gonna throw the
whole kit n kaboodle in, while you sit doodlin
Scribblin, now wipe your mouth cause it's dribblin
That's nasty, so how you gonna get past me?
Whatcha babblin punk?  I have to put a rattle in
your hand, and then I'll serve you like an infant
Put a bib on you, and feed you in-stan-taneously
Rhymes that'll be, famous from me
The Keith double-E, cause you're a faker
And I will take the mic from you and make the
brothers and sisters unite, while we relate the

	KNOWLEDGE KNOWLEDGE KNOWLEDGE (echoes)

[Damo D-Ski]
I'm glowin with intensity, cause I've been sent to G
off as your boss, because you lack identity
You're quite immature and, you sound very boring
Like a raft I'll bring you back, up onto the shore and
give you time to dry out, while I just try out
my hunch that with one punch, yo I could put that eye out
But violence, is never my first choice
I use my voice to make you rejoice
In agreement with our program, cause there is no man
Who can give you more of this, and you can be sure of this
fact that I'm exact, cause I got it down pat
We are scholars risin, we're exercisin our
