Song:   Trust Me
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[N'Dea]
I wanna trust you baby
I wanna trust you baby
Wanna trust you baby (trust me, I love you)
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I need you)
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I want you)
Wanna trust you babe (trust me)
Trust me, I love you
Trust me, I need you
Trust me, I want you
Trust me..

[Guru]
Baby why don'tcha, honey why won'tcha
accept the fact that it's not just the knack
that I care, so please let me share
special moments, moments so rare
Check it out, if I could give you the world, you know I'd do it
Everything at your feet - ain't nothin to it
But it's hard sweetheart, and it's rough out here
but I doubt there, is anybody else for me

[N'Dea]
Trust me, I love you
Trust me, I need you
Trust me, I want you
Trust me..
Trust me, I love you
Trust me, I need you
Trust me, I want you
Trust me..

[Guru]
Mmm the things I feel, they are for real
I'm past the point of dwellin, on the sex appeal
Mad chicks sweat me, but I desire your womanness
Dude sweats you, but I'm the best
Listen, we could build a future together
No doll and I would never soup you ever, never
I'm buggin out, over the thought of you leavin
Tried to step to you, but now you're retreatin

[N'Dea]
Trust me, I love you
Trust me, I need you
Trust me, I want you
Trust me..
Trust me, I love you
Trust me, I need you
Trust me, I want you
Trust me..

I do believe you do care
To tell you the truth, I am scared
Some freaky people out there
You know?

Trust me, I love you
Trust me, I need you
Trust me, I want you
Trust me..

[Guru]
I sent you flowers and, I sat for hours and
contemplated, the state of our affairs and I find there
is no way out I'm in a love lock
The funny thing about it I don't wanna even stop, so

[N'Dea]
Trust me, I love you
Trust me, I need you
Trust me, I want you
Trust me..
Trust me, I love you
Trust me, I need you
Trust me, I want you
Trust me..

[Guru]
So now you know the flavor
It's not about the stuff I gave ya
and my behavior is based on strong
feelings I have, of you and me, it's like a bond
A treasure, not to be corny but word
I wanna give you all the joy that you deserve
I know we argue, sometimes I start to annoy you
But we should never ever, try to destroy two
hearts joined, intertwined with a passion
Give me a chance love, that's all I'm askin
and furthermore, you can be sure that I'll do
every little thing you need, yes it's true
I'm not desperate, but I'm the one for you

[N'Dea]
Trust me, I love you
Trust me, I need you
Trust me, I want you
Trust me..
Trust me, I love you
Trust me, I need you
Trust me, I want you
Trust me..

Love is so risky y'know
I want you to do and show
me all of you openly
Honestly..

I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I love you)
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I need you)
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I want you)
I wanna trust you baby (trust me)
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I love you)
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I need you)
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I want you)
I wanna trust you baby (trust me)
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I love you)
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I need you)
I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I want you)
Wanna trust you babe (trust me)
I wanna trust you baby 
I wanna trust you baby 
I wanna trust you baby..</pre>
