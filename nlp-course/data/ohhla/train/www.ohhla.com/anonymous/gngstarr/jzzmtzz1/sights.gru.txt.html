Sights in the city got people cryin..

One Friday, little Emmitt reached his limit
School was wack, he wasn't with it
His man told him, that he could make some dough
Deliverin packages, for Mac Money Joe
so he said, "Cool.. yo I need a hustle
Yo hook me up, plus I need a pistol or
a .380, a two-two or a .25
I'm gonna get large kid, I'm all the way live"
But he was sadly mistaken
Now he's locked up, he's doin time and he's thinkin

[Carleen Anderson]
Sights in the city got people cryin..
Sights in the city got people dyin..
In the city..

[Guru]
One Saturday, sweet Renee ran away
Couldn't take moms yellin, didn't wanna stay
Her girl told her, that she could get quick cash
Goin on dates, for Pimp Daddy Nash
She said, "Well I don't know, I gotta meet him
You say he's fly, mmm?  I gotta see him"
The next thing you know she's out late nights
Makin dollars for Nash, wearin her skirts tight
Now she's a victim of the system
Man what happened to her dreams, and her ambition?

[Carleen Anderson]
Sights in the city got people cryin..
Sights in the city got people dyin..
Sights in the city got people cryin..
Sights in the city got people dyin..
In the city..

Old Mr. Fillmore, he owns a grocery store
It's a small little shop, the children call him Pop
But of course he keeps a shotgun
just for protection, cause he's got a little grandson
On Sunday, while he was there cleanin
He heard the front door slam, a lady screamin
He grabbed the shottie and walked out from the back
All he saw was two kids, wearin black ski masks
He fired, they fired, all at the same time
Now there's a funeral on Wednesay, a quarter to nine

[Carleen Anderson]
Sights in the city got people cryin..
Sights in the city got people dyin..
In the city..  in the city..  in the city..
In the city!  In the city..  in the city..
In the city..  in the city..  in the city..
In the city!  In the city!

[Guru]
Many sights and sounds in the city, knahmsayin?
People dyin, innocent victims
The babies ain't got no future
What are we gon' do?  Brothers can't make a buck
Mmm, just some of the sights and sounds, that's all
Gues I'm just gonna get mine</pre>
