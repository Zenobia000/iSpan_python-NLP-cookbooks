Artist: Guru f/ Roy Ayers *
Album:  Jazzmatazz Volume 1
Song:   Take a Look (at Yourself)
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

* featured artists on this album were jazz musicians

"A lot of people don't realize that..
 the reason why I'm talkin is.. I'm tired of most"

[Guru]
And I'm tired of suckers always complain about your situation
cause you frontin .. "You dig?"

Chorus: repeat 2X

Take a look at yourself, take a look at yourself
Take one big look, take a look at yourself .. "You dig?"

[Guru]
Came up short man (that's right)
Yes just one time too many (too many)
Don't try to get too friendly (nah)
I shouldn't give you any (none)
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, you know respect (yeah)
You're messed up son, tryin to play mack money (mack money)
You went for self, for the fast wealth, but you know what's funny?
Now you're fallin, fallin, cryin out for reasons (oww)
Should I sympathize, or let my lyrics give lesions,
and cuts?  Cause I can straighten you up
I ain't on no crusade (nope)
it's just that your game's played (yup)
But are you afraid, to make moves, and get really paid?
You might fade (goodbye) cause punk you live for today
And most of your chances, already blew away

Chorus

[Guru]
Listen (check it son)
Forget the dissin, I'm admittin
I've done some wrong, also wrote some dope songs (word)
My man Roy, he brought the vibes along
Now I'm there, in here gettin funky with the track
I used to drive a Cadillac, it took me there and back (right)
But seriously black, how you livin? (how you livin?)
From what I can see, word to mother you're slippin
If I were you, I'd stop this fantasy world stuff (quit it)
Cause the real world's tough, you ain't equipped enough
Step back, analyze, and use your own eyes to see
(take a look) I can't be you, you can't be me
For your problems, yo you can't blame no one else

Chorus

[Guru]
I ain't runnin away (never kid) yo are you?
I been through the BS, I got scars a few (many)
But I can't dwell in the hell that I've passed through (nope)
I'ma blast through (yup) and do what I gotta do (have to)
Amazing, suckers think this rap stuff won't phase them
I wait then, and cross the ceilings til they cave in (boom)
or give in, cause the power keeps me driven (that's right)
I'll de-stroy the weak noise with much poise and no toys
or tricks (nope) so stay off my tip
And get a grip on your own and get a life of your own
And stop waitin, for things to come to you
That's for chumps (that's right) I know what you oughta do

Chorus

[Guru]
Yeah I wanna give a big big shout out
to the Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and the Group Home
to my man Premier
Crazy shoutout to all the boroughs of New York
KnowhatI'msayin?
Cause my man Roy Ayers is in full effect

* Roy plays for a bit *

Chorus

* Roy closes out the song *</pre>
