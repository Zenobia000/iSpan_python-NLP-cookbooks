[Guru]
Yo I'm tired of chumps tryin to waste my time
I ain't got no time to play
Gotta make moves

Chorus: DC Lee

Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin every day
Never no time to play
Gotta make moves with no delay (I gotta make moves)
Never no time to play (No time to play)
Gotta keep workin every day
Never no time to play (I gotta make moves)
Gotta make moves

[Guru]
Nope, I can't stop, nope, I can't stop to talk
I gotta go I gotta go yo
Basically I'm a brother they depend on, lean on
So now I gotta be gone, I gotta keep strong
Always stayin busy kid, cause I can never fall off
Laziness ain't gettin to me
There's too much opportunity
And I'm not waitin for no one
Cause slow ones, they don't get nuttin done son

Chorus: DC Lee

Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin every day (No time to play)
Never no time to play
Gotta make moves with no delay (I gotta make moves)
Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin every day (No time to play)
Never no time to play
Gotta make moves (I gotta make moves)

[Guru]
Your time is runnin short sport
Make a move or get caught
Nothing lasts forever, nothing lasts forever baby
Maybe, you shouldn't act so crazy
Instead of tryin to be the man
you could REALLY be the man, if you had a plan, understand?
But I'm not the one to be waitin for ya
Back in the day, I used to do stuff for ya
Now I'm warnin ya
that you really ain't no pimp you wimp

Chorus: DC Lee

Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin every day (No time to play)
Never no time to play
Gotta make moves with no delay (I gotta make moves)
Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin every day
Never no time to play
(I gotta make moves) Gotta make moves

[Guru]
I gotta make moves, each and every day
I need the cash, I need the cash mo-ney
With my rhyme display, I may take all the paper
wild, I guess I have the know-how
When you see me in the house you better go, "What's up G?
What's up Gang?"  Then give me a pound
because I've been down, dedicated and I've waited
for my turn, cause respect is somethin you earn

Chorus: DC Lee

Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin every day
Never no time to play (uhh, I gotta make moves)
Gotta make moves with no delay
Never no time to play (No time to play)
Gotta keep workin every day
Never no time to play (I gotta make moves)
Gotta make moves

Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin every day
Never no time to play
Gotta make moves with no delay
Never no time to play
Gotta keep workin every day
Never no time to play
Gotta make moves

Never no time to play
Gotta make moves

Never no time to play
No time to play, ahh
Never no time to play
Gotta make moves

	Ain't got no time
	I ain't got no time
	Ain't got no time
	I ain't got no time
No time to play
	I ain't got no time
No time to play
	No time, to play
No time to play
	Ain't got no time
No time to play
	No no time to play
No time to play
	I ain't got no time
No time to play
	I ain't got no time
No time to play
	No time to play
No time to play-ohhh-ooooh-ahhh
	Ain't got no time
	I ain't got no time
	I ain't got no time
	Never have the time
Never no time to play
	No time to play
	No time to play
	No time to play
	No time to play-ayyy-hey

[Guru]
No time to play
My man Ronny Jordan gets busy on guitar
DC Lee and Big Shug in the house
Big shouts to the crew
Whassup to the Cutthroats, slicker than most
I ain't got no time yo so I'm gone, I'm gone</pre>
