[intro]
dedicated to my son, that's about to be born
so by the time you people hear this record, my son'll be born
and i gotta teach him about life

[guru]
listen
to my little man
you can never have too little plans
always bring your game direct, cut out the middle man
life is full of sacrifice, for truth you might have to fight
someone'll bring you down
cause they ain't livin right
be sure to use your mind, though
look for all the signs, yo
don't want to make a move too quick and get left behind, yo
be in command of whatever you encounter
appreciate your blessings, son, you'll see what it amounts to
obtaining your goals, maintainin control
self-respect helps you to protect your soul
never give up, always be ready to try
walk your own walk, and keep your head to the sky

[chorus: amel larrieux]
  little thing now here you are
  staring at me with those baby eyes
  all you do is sleep, eat, and cry
  but one day you're gonna be askin me why
  everything i know i'm gonna tell you about
  anything i don't you'll figure out
  cause living is learnin and learnin is livin
  and then you pass it on

[guru]
and to my home boys, who clearly understand
what it really takes to be a man and what it means to be the head of fam
the ups and downs of life plus the choices we make
causes to reevaluate directions we take
and being up in the club is mad fun til they act dumb
and everyone still packs guns whether nines or mac one-ones
it's time now for us to seperate the mediocre from the great
keep all the jokers from the game
i've played my position, so why don't you try to play yours
i've made my decision, plus you're in my prayers
my life is changed now, plus i got a shorty now
mad responsibilities, it's like i'm almost forty now
all the young girls wanna swing, my wifey says she wants a ring
i wonder what the next days, are gonna bring
we must live and fight for the right causes and be ready to die
i love you kid, so keep your head to the sky

[chorus: amel larrieux]
  little thing now here you are
  staring at me with those baby eyes
  all you do is sleep, eat, and cry
  but one day you're gonna be askin me why
  everything i know i'm gonna tell you about
  anything i don't you'll figure out
  cause living is learnin and learnin is livin
  and then you pass it on

[amel larrieux]
baby child did you know
every since you fell out of the heavens
you make me wanna grow
so i'll share with you everything
make little girls and boys grow up to be kings and queens

[chorus: amel larrieux]
  little thing now here you are
  staring at me with those baby eyes
  all you do is sleep, eat, and cry
  but one day you're gonna be askin me why
  everything i know i'm gonna tell you about
  anything i don't you'll figure out
  cause living is learnin and learnin is livin
  and then you pass it on

[chorus: amel larrieux]
  little thing now here you are
  staring at me with those baby eyes
  all you do is sleep, eat, and cry
  but one day you're gonna be askin me why
  everything i know i'm gonna tell you about
  anything i don't you'll figure out
  cause living is learnin and learnin is livin
  and then you pass it on</pre>
