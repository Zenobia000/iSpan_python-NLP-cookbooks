Artist: Guru f/ Mica Paris
Album:  Jazzmatazz Volume 2: The New Reality
Song:   Looking Through Darkness
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Guru]
You know sometimes I be lookin through the darkness
Tryin to find the light
Tryin to do what's right, with all my might

[Mica Paris]		(Guru)
Lookin through the darkness 
(Yeah I'm lookin, lookin at you)
Lookin through the darkness
(I see you lookin at me, whatcha wanna wanna do?)
Lookin through the darkness
(Here we go.. take a walk with me)
(Lookin through the darkness..
 Check it out.. now now.. now now, now now)

[Guru]
Now as I peer through the window of gloom, and everyday living
And all the hardships one faces, to make you give in
I dig more intensely, finding greater strength
A lot of heads is empty, I've got a greater rank
than MC's not aware of situations
that'll force one to understand, true stipulations
Thou shalt not bite, thou shalt not front
Fake it if you want but for the battles I've come, cause I'm

[Mica Paris]		(Guru)
Lookin through the darkness 
(Yeah, I'm lookin out.. lookin at you)
Lookin through the darkness
(Lookin at me, my style is free, do you wanna be?)

[Guru]
For me this rap life is real life, I don't have to create
some false image, to make the crowd get hyped
Too many children get the wrong message, from clowns that walk around
hopelessly lost, thinkin that they're the boss
They're in a daze, while dope MC's don't get the front page
Me -- I try to channel my rage
As I travel through the city regularly
Turning the anger and frustration, straight into energy
Yes you will remember me; as the brother who cared
to dare to step up, with his soul bared
But never fearing cause I've got instructions
from Him, to go and fight the corruption so I'm

[Mica Paris]		(Guru)
Lookin through the darkness 
(I've got to look through it.. try to try to find the light)
Lookin through the darkness
(Uhh, maintainin..)

[Guru]
My granddaddy always told me, to keep the light shining
So as my mic illuminates, you can feel the state that I'm in
Thoroughly immersed in a verse, way more than hardcore
I endure, cause in myself, I'm secure
Delivering syllables and selections with profound perfection
Comin back like the resurrection
In this session, I'm professin, that those who don't
hear and understand, never loved me, and so I planned
to take a stand, as one who is firmly focused
Plus I'm mad worthy with words
I rock from East New York, all the way to the suburbs
The lightkeeper, knowledge seeker
I switch the stress that's on my mind
into the voice that rocks your speaker
And I get deeper than the ocean when I'm

[Mica Paris]		(Guru)
Lookin through the darkness 
(Yeah.. I'm lookin through it)
Lookin through the darkness
(Ain't nothing to it but to do it..
 Gotta freak it, now let me freak it check it out)
Lookin through the darkness
(All my life)
(Lookin through the darkness..
 Yeah, ohh yeah)

[Guru]
Yo I'm so ill, I go ill, when beats with jazz
fill my need to express myself, like the blues I can't lose
Weak MC's, they're seekin refuge
from my barrage, there's no rescue
Then I look through the madness, finding sanity
I'm crazy alert, I never swim in vanity
I do this rap stuff every year
Aiyyo peace to my fam especially my man Premier as I'm

[Mica Paris]		(Guru)
Lookin through the darkness 
(Yeah.. lookin out, to the wilderness)
Lookin through the darkness
(the jungle, uhh, everybody's got to rumble)
Lookin through the darkness
(Lookin through the darkness..)

[Mica Paris]		(Guru)
Lookin through the darkness 
Lookin through the darkness 
(Got to find my way, doin my own thing)
Lookin through the darkness 
(Walkin through the darkness)
Got to find a way..
Got to get, got to get it on
(Can you see the light?)
Got to get, got to get, got to get it on
(Peace aight?)
Lookin through the darkness 
Lookin through the darkness 
Got to get, got to get, I've got to get it on
Lookin through the darkness 
Got to get, got to get, I've got to get it on

Got to get, got to get, I've got to get it on</pre>
