Artist: Guru f/ Sweet Sable
Album:  Jazzmatazz Volume 2: The New Reality
Song:   Living in This World
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Sweet Sable]
Living, in this world
What's happening?
Living, in this world
What's happening?

[Guru]
What's happening.. check it out
It's critical, the situation is pitiful
Bear in mind, you gotta find somethin spiritual
We never gain, cause we blame it on the system
You oughta listen whether Muslim or Christian
or any other type religion or creed
Cause what we need is less greed
We can't continue to kill ourselves
We gotta build and expand our wealth
So one more time I'll design a rhyme divine
to educate and elevate your mind
Nowadays we gotta fight to live
Human means we got a right to live
without the homicide, without the genocide
Don't tell me let it slide, I'm feelin ghettofied
So be a soldier of truth
Protect the lives of our youth

[Sweet Sable]
Living, in this world
What's happening?
Living, in this world
What's happening?

[Guru]
What's happening
In the land of the free, home of the brave
too many of us reach such early graves
They tell us to behave, but they don't know
about the neighborhood drug flow
They don't know about the drama or about the guns
I ask how many politicians steal our funds
and how many officers will turn up corrupt
The governments don't care, they pass the buck
I'm growin tired of the trickery
and the misery, it's makin me kinda sick you see
But now I meditate, so I can get it straight
My thoughts penetrate, so I control my fate
So be advised by the wise and concious one
We take the easy way out, too often son
We better get some kind of work ethic
Realize it and correct it

[Sweet Sable]
Living, in this world
What's happening?
Living, in this world
What's happening?

[Guru]
What's happening
From New York to L.A., dead children lay
Victims of an unfair socie-ty
But for those who are blessed
we must correct this mess, or dissapear into nothingness
We're living in the age of doom
How many teachers reach all the kids in the classroom?
The beast is stalking us, but there's no stopping us
as long as we maintain the strength within us
Cause we're winners, descendants of the kings
They try to hinder us from doin our thing
So get the money, but spend it wisely
I get ill when the beats hypnotize me
Realize that the key
is for each, to master, his own destiny
Deal with reality, and keep a tight focus
Cause there's a lot we got to cope with

[Sweet Sable]
Living, in this world
What's happening?
Living, in this world
What's happening?

Living, in this world
What's happening?
Living, in this world
What's happening?

Living, in this world
What's happening?
Living, in this world
What's happening?</pre>
