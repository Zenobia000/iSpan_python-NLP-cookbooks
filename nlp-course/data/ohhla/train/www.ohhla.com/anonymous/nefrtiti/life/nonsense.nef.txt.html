Artist: Nefertiti f/ Guru
Album:  L.I.F.E. - (Living In Fear of Extinction)
Song:   No Nonsense
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Nefertiti]
In, ninety-three, that's how it's gonna be (*repeat 7X*)

[Nefertiti - over previous sample, starting 4th repeat]
Cease and seckle that nonsense
Cease and seckle that nonsense kid
Cease and seckle that nonsense
Cease and seckle that nonsense kid

{*scratched: "kill that mess"*}

[Nefertiti]
I write rhymes, take it like catch my flight and carry-on
I drop bombs like your moms when she blowin up the spot
Damn why not?  I get hot hot like fire
Slick like Shaft, nah me think about me retirin
I get deep, niggaz ain't tryin to sleep
SO PEEP IT OUT

[Guru]
Suckers, just don't get the picture
We'll hit you up quick, and the crew is nuff sick
So stick to, stick to the point pass the blunt
cause chumps are ridin on the joint
Murderers they come in all shapes and sizes
Evil fools meet doom, as my crime booms loudest
How's this, for wreckin shop, cause you should stop

{*scratched: "kill that mess"*}

[Nefertiti - over scratch]
Cease and seckle that nonsense
Cease and seckle that nonsense kid
Cease and seckle that nonsense
Cease and seckle that nonsense kid

[Nefertiti]
I liberate your mind and what you find I climb inside
The bare facts is what's attractin you to nap me
Still plays like loops salute my troops of course I blow my horn
What you find is I'm blind to the fact I don't
search or bluff so boy you're BEST TO STEP BACK

[Guru]
Observe nerd, word is bond we are notorious
Got some suckers wishin that I wasn't so serious
You can front for a while, like you ain't with it though
But I'm deckin chumps quick, as if I was Riddick Bowe
From Brooklyn and peace to L.A., time to slay
Cause the weak-minded can't find it

{*scratched: "kill that mess"*}

[Nefertiti - over scratch]
Cease and seckle that nonsense kid
Cease and seckle that nonsense
Cease and seckle that nonsense kid
Cease and seckle that nonsense

[Guru]
What kid? You're buggin; I think you need to taste real skill
Now you feel ill, and next is Nef's dirll

[Nefertiti]
In God I trust, I'm kickin up nuff dust so
scream oh scream if you feel like screamin
Villains have no soul, you tamper with my seed to
discover the truths of my inside's black born
The, shit you kickin, I'm flippin cause you blow my mind
(AIYYO!) Still standin, demandin and consume my time
I can't explain the stain on yo' brain
Why don't you rattle your slave chain, take it to the shotgun range
My voice gets wet, so put me back up on the set
Check the script, cause kid you need to quit

{*scratched: "kill that mess"*}

[Nefertiti - over scratch]
Cease and seckle that nonsense kid
Cease and seckle that nonsense
Cease and seckle that nonsense kid
Cease and seckle that nonsense
Cease and seckle that nonsense kid
Cease and seckle that nonsense
Cease and seckle that nonsense kid
Cease and seckle that nonsense

[Nefertiti]
In, ninety-three, that's how it's gonna be (*repeat 4X*)

Hmm, yeah
I wanna give a shout out to the Zulu Nation
(The Zulu Nation) The Zulu Nation
My homegirl Lyte and all those that paved the way
Oh what more can I say?
I, still dig through the rubble for that nigga named Trouble
But, I guess that's how it goes
And my, peoples in L.A. (yeahhh)
Uhh, the folks in L.A. (Brooklyn)
Brooklyn's in the house (yeahhh)
I said Brooklyn's in the house

[Guru]
Peace out y'all, and check it out
Stop the nonsense</pre>
