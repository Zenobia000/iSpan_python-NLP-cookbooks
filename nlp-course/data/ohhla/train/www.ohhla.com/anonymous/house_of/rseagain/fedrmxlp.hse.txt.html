Song:   Fed Up (Album Remix)
Typed by: dy_face@hotmail.com

[Intro: Everlast]
Yeah, ha ha, you know what time it is?
House of Pain, killer rhyme Klik upon this piece
CT, LK, gifted unlimited, Everlast, what's up?
Ha ha, you know the entrepreneurs baby, what time is it?
Ha ha

[Everlast]
I say brothers are amused by other brothers reps
But they're all playing roles just like Omar Epps
I see so many players, I wonder where the coach is
My name is Everlast, I'm hard to kill like roaches
The dough that you're making has got you fronting and faking
Your heart's been shook, brain's cooked like bacon
Can't believe you're not butter, you thought you was on it
Out trying to flaunt it, but it's just Blue Bonnet
And now it's my turn, kid, so watch me churn
There's only so many spots, they're Hard to Earn

[Guru]
Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
Too many men are judged by the color of the skin
The apparatus gets blessed, suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure I got the cure for this mess
The whackness is spreading like the plague
MC's they wanna get paid but they can't make the fucking grade
How many times are wannabe-us gonna try?
Yo, they must wanna die cause they can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness carrying my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When I start to go all out, you be like: "Damn he flipped"
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
I got the lyrical full clip

[Everlast]
When you sell out to appeal to the masses
You have to go back and enroll in some classes
All you curve pieces start shaking your asses
All you blunt holders take two pulls and pass it
Back in '89 I dropped too much acid
Back from Lake Havasu, out to Lake Placid
While you're busy bragging on the people you blasted
I'm asking how many days have you fasted

[Chorus: Everlast X2]
Get up, I'll break you down a little something
I'm fed up, it's time to go head hunting
Dead up, so many crews be fronting
I'm fed up, it's time to go head hunting

[Guru]
I'm sick, demented, I smacked my manager
The flow-fessional, addressing all y'all immatures
And to your back, I got the Tre Piounce Siete
Tell me why you're trying to claim that you a gangster, baby?
But let's suppose you really had a burner (Suppose)
You would still need some lessons on how to hold it firmer
Fuck a murder, I'ma just kill your ego
Cause we know, that you ain't really got no people
Murdering a prop, my man, this my homey that
You need to get the fuck out my face cause you don't know me jack

[Everlast]
I chant eeny, meeny, miney, moe...
I put seeds in your mental and I watch them grow
Turn on the instrument and clock my flow
Put the dough in my pocket then I rock the show
Cause I know, and you know, this is how we do
Salâmu alaykum to the Muslim, shalom to the Hebrew
Greed, lust, envy, sloth, gluttony, pride and wrath 
Do the math; these seven deadly sins represent my jinn
You're scheaming on testing me, kid, where you been
I've been told all my life, I'm my only friend
There's a killer on the road, money it's the end
And you might think that I'm a dummy
But while you're out at the spot, I'm home chilling with your honey

[Guru]
I kick flavor, like Steven King I write the horror
If you wanna see tomorrow when I lead you're best to follow
Or you'll be left along the road in the dust
And me and you won't have too much to discuss
I don't know why, MCs will come to test for iodine
Master of myself, my wealth, it's just my state of mind
I stack my loot, just for a rainy day
And you can parch on your fourty, for rappers I slay
I'm the quick draw, the outlaw, I doubt y'all
Ready to fuck with me, so boy stop
Or I'ma beat your ass like your Popps
[Everlast] Get the real estate money and then the props

[Chorus: Everlast X2]
