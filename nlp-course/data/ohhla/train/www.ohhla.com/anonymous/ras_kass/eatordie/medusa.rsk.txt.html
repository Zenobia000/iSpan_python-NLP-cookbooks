Artist: Ras Kass f/ Nas
Album:  Eat or Die
Song:   Medusa
Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Intro)
Right now you up in the club and you see that bitch
that you've just broke up with (Uh, tramp, stank bitch)
'cause she was fucking ya homeboy
(The bitch ain't no good for ya homey)
You know what I'm saying? Just have a drink and think about it

(Chorus) 2X
She loves me, she loves me not
But looking in her eyes make my dick turn to rock

[Nas] {*Sample from "One Love"*}
Yeah, shorty don't care she's a snake too
Fucking with them niggas from that fake Crew that hate you
Medusa

[Ras Kass]
Slow ass from the front, camel toast so phat
(WHY?) Bow-legged sexy ass gap
Man I'm eating tangerine clowie Gucci cutters
Pussy so good, it feel like long butter
She likes moaning, Michael Kors, Dior
Polo, Chanel Couture and Tom Ford
Dime piece like Sanaa Lathan
Cooley Hindu, mess with entire Jamaican
Had a nigga like me chasing
But she the daughter of Satan, fake, she's a snaking
YOU'RE, SO, FUCKING SPECIAL!!
No she ain't no good but I just can't let go
Venomous sinking in her fangs, while she giving me brain
Playing head game, pleasure and pain
Leaving head migraines use ya, abuse ya
After she seduce ya, Medusa

(Chorus) 2X

[Ras Kass]
Promised to be my ride or die
Groomed her a long time, I fell in love with her lie
Mama neva liked you (NO), I wish I neva met her
Trying to get her out of my system and do better
Put the voodoo roots on me
I wanna leave but my heart won't let me
Get jetty, trying to figure out what she mixed in my spaghetti
Addicted to Jessica Rabbit in the black Teddy
Said - "You'll never forget me"
Went to jail, "Judge can I bail?"
Bitch sent me hate mails (WHAT?)
Break up, should make up, it's not a joke
She switched up her tongue, long cocked throat
Make love to Aaliyah, rock the boat, work the middle
Change position, missionary, wishing he took Ecstasy
Make a blind man see, a cripple man climbing tree
Whether you're floetry, all you gotta do is say "Yes"
Hand up a dress, fangs in my neck

(Movie sample)
"Hit me, I'm Medusa, that block is a deeply venomous"

(Chorus) 2X

[Ras Kass]
No matter what I do, I ain't neva good enough
It's just my downfall and a good fuck
The homey say I'm whipped
'Cause I go back to you every time I say "I quit"
It's like the Rock song - I love you, I hate you
I just can't live without you
Forget about it, had to do a bid without you
Going got tough, the chick got going
Looking for already made nigga
Basically out here hoeing
Why I ever tried to make you happy, I'm not knowing
Sick of arguing, having to fight women
She the reason black women losing their men to white women
(Don't be mad) Pussy lips shaped like money clips
Twenty-four inch waist, thirty-six inch hips
Used to be my honey dip; now you're just that funny bitch
Hopped back on my dick on some dummy shit
She getting jealous and bitchy (HA-HA)
'Cause my new chick is hot and look like Britney
Can get more cheddar then you
Chocolate complected, and her pussy better then you, BITCH!

(Chorus) 2X</pre>
