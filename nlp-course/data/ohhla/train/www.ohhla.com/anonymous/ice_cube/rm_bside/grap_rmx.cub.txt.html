Artist: Ice Cube f/ Nas, Scarface
Album:  Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It (Remix) 12"
Song:   Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It (Remix)
Typed by: DaSun Akbar
 
Blame me... (*echo*)
 
(Interlude) Cube
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow (*echo*)
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R A W - R A W
 
[Ice Cube]
You're looking at the Grand Wizard
War lord, vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches
To pull up pull off with some bad bitches
And it ain't about shivery
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona
Ain't nothing like a man that can do what he wanna
Ain't nothing like man that you knew on the corner
Seen 'em come up and fuck up the owner
Seen 'em throw up Westside California
Nigga I'm hot as Phoenix Arizona
I'm Utah, I got multiple bitches
It's a new law, keep a hold of your riches
Dumb nigga don't spend it as soon as you get it
And recognize I'ma Captain, you're a Lieutenant
 
(Chorus) Cube
I can say what I want to say, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
 
[Scarface]
Nah nigga blame me, for severing cocaine to the geeks
Gangbanging the streets, shooting guns where you sleep
Putting niggas in sheets, the noose hung from the tree
The corrupted police, I ain't denying it was me
I'm the reason for the set back in blacks
It's a natural fact, that gangsta rap did that
I hope that Barack could pull the troops for Iraq
'Cause the truth is Iran, got them nuclear plants
I can shoot me a cat in the head with a gat
For a man that considers me a nigger when I'm back in the slums
Waiting for a check like a bum
Look how I did them niggas often numb
Hard, I got the strolls full of hoes
Liquor stores off the road
Big church on the corner with a spot for my rose
A glock for my foes, wiping snot from my nose
I'm guilty of it all, but I am not 'fenna fold
 
(Chorus) Cube
So if I act like a pimp, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappy headed hoe, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
 
[Nas]
Uh, if they call you a nigger, ain't nuttin to it
Tell 'em Nas made you do it
Felonious, Thelonious Monk melodic; Monster Cody OG
Hard as Rampart's police, warring like the ends was in Sunni
I never pull my pants up, sagging my Gucci's, and what?
I give a fuck who you bidded with, or where you cop coke
The bitch you with or the reason you're not broke
I don't count your money, don't want none of your smoke
I don't feel your pain, I ain't none of your folk
It's easy to put a gun in your throat
But I ain't on that, trying to sip Colada's where it's warm at
Cognac, crushed ice, y'all know how it is
Elijah said - A women half your age plus seven years
It's a plush way to live, this is for the blunted
For the niggas who keep it one hundred
Who're hunted by DA's and Judges
 
(Chorus) Cube
If I sell a liitle crack, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
 
(Interlude) Cube
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow (*echo*)
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R A W - R A W
 
(Outro) Cube
Oh yeah and another thing
For all ya niggas that don't do gangsta rap
Don't get on TV talking about gangsta rap
'Cause nine times at a ten you don't know the fuck you're talk about
Talk about that bullshit rap you do
Stay the fuck out of mines</pre>
