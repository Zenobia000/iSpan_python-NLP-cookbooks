Album:  All of the Above
Song:   Like This Anna
Typed by: pajdusko@hotmail.com

(Background:)
It's like this, Anna, it's like that, Anna
It's like this, Anna, it's like that, Anna
It's like this, Anna, it's like that, Anna
So much hair I can't even wear a hat, Anna
It's like this, Anna, it's like that, Anna
Am I supposed to still think the world flat, Anna

(Lead:)
It's like this, Anna, it's like that, Anna
I'm only starin' cause your ass is so fat, Anna
I noticed as soon as you walked up in the place, Anna (damn!)
You can't blame a man for havin' good taste, can ya?
That's not fair, Anna, it's not right, Anna
Please turn around or I'll be starin' all night, Anna
So many men, Anna, they wanna play, Anna
They all wanna get their name up in your day planner
I swear, even if it's only for a day, Anna
For a majority, you'd be the only way, Anna
It's on you, Anna, what you gonna do, Anna?
I'm hopin' that's the type of man you see through, Anna
Whether you're lookin' for ménage or a matrimony
A man say he wanna be your lovin' friend, homey
Just keep your eyes open so that you can spot a phony
A lot of snakes wanna get up in your tenderoni
Unless you're just horny and wanna ride a pony
You'd rather be left alone than left lonely
It's like this, Anna, we both know, Anna
It's kinda nice when a man spend dough, Anna
Although, Anna, you can't salary cap your mojo, Anna
You're not a ho, Anna, it's okay if all systems ain't go, Anna
You gotta tell a brother "no means no," Anna

CHORUS:
It's like this, Anna
this is a message to my homegirl, Miss Anna
You're so fly, Anna
I can't let nobody desecrate my Anna
I'm not your man, Anna
I just really want you to understand, Anna
Life is rough, but, uh
Somebody cares enough to tell you this stuff, Anna

(Repeat CHORUS)

Hey yo, you can either dance and check the rhyme later or hear me out now
A lot of these ballers at the plate don't care if they fair or they foul
It doesn't mean that you should stop trustin' all brothers, straight
throwin' in the towel
The next just might just be just right, like Baby Bear style
But choose wise, don't bother with the knucklehead that can't teach you shit
And never ever think you gotta tolerate a man that's gonna beat you, kid
But please don't toy with their heads like "green light 1, 2, 3,"'
Cause that's the kinda blue ball game that even frustrates guys like me
But you're ill, girl, full o' ideas, like the five-figure salary career
And a education take you ten years
And a man that'a give you both ears
When you talkin' ‘bout your hopes and your fears
And you're damn near ‘bout to shed tears
Cause your baby been coughin' all day
And the daddy ain't there and won't pay
And there's so much drama round the way
Cause the streets are too dangerous to play
And the world got you feelin' insecure
Cause you think you're fine, but you're not sure
But your beauty lies not just in your booty
But your face, all natural (it's a cutie!)
Don't you ever let the bullshit blind you
If you forget, I'll be quick to remind you

(CHORUS, 4x)

It's like this...  it's like that, Anna
It's like this, Anna, it's like that, Anna
It's like this, Anna, it's like that, Anna
It's like this, Anna, it's like that, Anna
It's like this, Anna, it's like that, Anna
It's like this, Anna, it's like that, Anna
It's like this</pre>
