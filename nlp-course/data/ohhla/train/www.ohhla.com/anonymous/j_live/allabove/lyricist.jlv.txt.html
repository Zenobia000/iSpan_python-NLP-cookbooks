[Verse 1]
Dear diary, here I be droppin' some shit
But not journals and memoirs, lines and bars
I stretch my hands out to reach for the stars
I'm makin' plans now to live on Mars
Cause I got Earth on lock
See my mind is like a muse to a paper
Cause I'm used to a paper-drawn blank
Till it's got me to think
And I just dip it in my think tank
Fill it with anger and
Run straight through the lines cause I can't be stopped
And pose my will on words even if they won't
For example I make words rhyme even when they don't
With the ample vocabulary even with the quote
I make it mind on mind till I'm done with it
Cause I had fun with it
Pick it up and run with it
Score it and spike it and
Don't take a second to figure out you like it
And if you think you can find a match then strike it
It won't ignite, cause it can't fill my Nikes
With the man made lake and the dam and the dyke
And the canal it still can't float quite like
This natural feel brake your move make it night
Cause my mic sound right even when I write like this

[Verse 2]
I get up in the zone like a super saiyan
Sayin' sayin' sayin' sayin' super humans
Wan to say them over drunk n' sober
Mere mortals make a mission out of mixin' me
With masterpieces just so they can bring them home and play them over
I dip into theory till I catch their theory, it's scarier then waiting to exhale
You must know by the time I tap keys,
With relative ease I'll be contemplating my next tale
I stay steps ahead thinkin' about the reps ahead
By the time you cluin' in it's your rep I'm movin' in
It's like a double ban both side screwin' in
Your foot in your mouth and my foot in your rear end
I wanna get to the point where I don't gotta to crush the competition
Just because they wanna see my style
I'm tryin' to get to the level where the rebel see the power of my empire
And decide wait a while

[Verse 3]
Let me explain, this is expository while they shut themselves out
To open arms and harms way shook by what dreams made
Force themselves upon pond screamin they pond
That's why rappers run shallow and my ponds are far gone
Cool like cal gone just back from california and lands beyond
Lettin' foreigners hear my songs and back to spawn some more
Some on, some on, some lost, some in, some out, all in without a doubt
Some rise by sunrise, while some guys
Try to summarize those that walk in fall but can't crawl
See I'm hip to a critic, cause they hypocritic
Its critical to what I'm kickin, just a little bit political
So consider this a PSA from USA to UK
Say what you wanna say
But if you wanna say what everybody else is gonna say
Just remember don't play games with J</pre>
