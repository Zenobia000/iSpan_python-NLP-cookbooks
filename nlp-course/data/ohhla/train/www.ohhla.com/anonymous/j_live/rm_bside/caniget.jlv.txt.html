Verse 1
-------

It was a summer mornin' at the age of eighteen
I'll start the story in the shower singin' Microphone Fiend
Tryna figure my routine for the day
There's mad things to do with no delay
In preparation for this jam around the way
I'm steppin' out the shower
Crossin' out the calender
Pickin' out the afro and pullin' out the gear
I hear the same sounds every mornin'
Sports centre, the traffic
Your mom dukes screamin' in my ear
Dipped, yet my thoughts slip
Thinkin' that my plans just barely coincide with my money clip
But get a grip cos by the end of the day, bro
Your pockets'll be a-ight, even before the crowd says 'A-yo!'
I jet up to Lex, take the 6 to the R
My journey wouldn't feel as far if I had a car
5-O was there, so I paid my fare
But I didn't care 'til he gave a glare, who you tryna scare?
I'm passin' flyers to a crew of fly young sisters
A chicken from my past is actin' crab, so I had to diss her
My head bops and my fingers pops 'til I reach my stop
Then I mush my way through to the record shop

Can I get it one time for the selector?
Does he come correct in your sector?
Indoors or an outside jam
Can I get it if ya understand?

Verse 2
-------

As I exit stage right, lookin' forward to the night
It's official, Imma have this party packed tight like toilet tissue
What's the issue? I'm never comin' wack
We never lack the latest flavour, keepin' crates stacked
Buyin' records by the pack
With my knapsack filled as I chilled
On the C-Train, simple and plain, let me explain
I had to check my man Gee for his m-i-c
Cos the way we be mine simply couldn't maintain
As usual Gee was on C.P Time
But he came through with this mic, plus this bleeder light, right
My next step was to transport the system
Let's see, between me and my peeps five deep
We still had no ride
So I hailed a taxi, since the yellow's don't stop
And it don't quit, you know we went gypsy
Arrivin' on the scene at about eight-fifteen
To the same routine, some sheisty brother frontin' on my green
Never that, nah mean? Check this out, black
Skip the non-sense cos Imma say this just once
I want the money we discussed last week
Plus you're payin' for my ride
I'll take my loot upfront with no stunts, bro
Put your chequebooks away, no pay no J
No J no sound play, you make no profit, understand?
Plus your name was on the flyers so your rep'll be dead
What he said? Not a thing, he put the cash in my hand...

Can I get it one time for the selector?
Does he come correct in your sector?
Indoors or an outside jam
Can I get it if ya understand?
Can I get it one time for the selector?
Does he come correct in your sector?
Old school or a new school jam
Can I get it if ya understand?

Verse 3
-------

On the line perplexed, fixed to flex cos you're far from next
And the next one to bump you from the back gets his chin checked
But I don't know about that cos I'm already in there
And I got ya grinnin' when you hear your favourite record spinnin'
So skip it, cos now you're bouncin' to the door
But if you're riffin' with the bouncers
You'll be bouncin' straight up off the floor
So if you're mad at the security
(Sadat X: It don't mean jack to me...that's how it's supposed to be)
As I mix Walk on By over Passin' Me By
Seem like everybody puffin' but I'm contact high
Off this fresh new wax, with the real brown sugars makin' eye contact
React, what's the haps? It's digits or excuses?
I'm pullin' out the pen and she supplies the data
Flavour, but for now I got tracks to spin
So if you're stayin' til the end we can handle this later
Torturin' the fader, the Tech 12 freaker
The bass from the amps shake the stickers off the speaker
I don't claim to have the loudest sound in town
But from the inside it felt like the ground shaked from Lenox to Bleecker
Circles form, dance contests
Most know how I do while the rest make requests
But Imma play what you wanna hear anyway
So get your boogie on and parley

Can I get it one time for the selector?
Does he come correct in your sector?
Old school or a new school jam
Can I get it if ya understand?
Can I get it one time for the selector?
Does he come correct in your sector?
Outside or an indoor jam
Can I get it if ya understand?
