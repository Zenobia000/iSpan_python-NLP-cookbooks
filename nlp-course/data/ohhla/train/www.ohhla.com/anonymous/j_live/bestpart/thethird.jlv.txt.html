(*scratching of "let me tell you" from Pharcyde's "Passin' Me By"*)

[verse 1 - The Third Eye]
For the first third
I had to borrow three words from Stevie for the issue
For what it's worth I'm calling this official
To live and die for you is to live and die with you
If what we got ain't superficial or artificial
I feel at home with you if I share my dome with you
Develop your mind to understand mine and grow with you
It's hypothetical I have yet to meet you
But all it takes is time well spent alone with you
?? could move along to reach the 8th rank
To resurrect with the grace of a queen she will receive and reflect
Knowing just what I mean when I claim that I protect my useful land 
like the fearless grown man that I am
With the plan to expand it's painstakin'
Like feedin' food for thought and regulatin' mental bakin'
Correcting each other when we're mistaken and debatin'
Turns to arguing but other ?? leads to the best earthquakin'
But still in all I needs no reminder
that God will be the maker and owner but not the finder
So in this wilderness I will reserve the Best Part
For each queen I meet I make it known from the start
When I tell ya like this.....

(Chorus w/ same background scratching as the intro)
"You can get the third; 
eye or the leg or the finger if deferred
I know what's on ya mind so sis ya need to say the word
Eye or the leg or finger if deferred
Imma tell ya like this, you can get the third
eye or the leg or the finger if deferred
I know what's on ya mind so sis ya need to say the word
Eye or the Leg or the Bird..."

[verse 2 - The Third Leg]
I set the speed in which you twist upon ya axis
From changing ya thoughts to turnin' over on the mattress
The fact is the culture that I practice 
prescribes me the father of the civil so most muthafuckas lack this
More often than not the type of woman I attract is
lookin' to discover just another piece of steel 
And you can test my heart ?? 
but see I can't be trapped by my magnetic field
To bring it down to earth I'm talking bout your sex appeal
You've got the good ?? and yes you know I know tha deal
Not even too concerned on who's the last and next to feel
cuz the sword that a weild sports a lubricated shield
The only problem is you never take the time to build
and then you've got the nerve to say I treat you like a freak?!
I try to chill and conversate with you but ?? don't stop
and that's my spot yo we hardly even speak
So get to know the mind behind the dick that I'm slingin'
Next time when I'm done yo try not to fall asleep
But still in all I really can't complain about ya "brain"
cuz you're the first on my mind when the time comes to creep
That's why Imma tell ya like this....

(Chorus w/ scratch of "my dear my dear my dear you do not know me")
"You can get the third; 
eye or the leg or the finger if deferred
I know what's on ya mind so sis ya need to say the word
Eye or the leg or finger if deferred
Imma tell ya like this, you can get the third
eye or the leg or the finger if deferred
I know what's on ya mind so sis ya need to say the word
Eye or the Leg or the Bird..." {*echoing*}

[verse 3 - The Third Finger]
I could've been chillin' with peeps
I should've been spending more time relaxing asleep
I woulda been pushin' up on girls like the first two
but instead I was wasting time fuckin' with you!
On some bottom line shit I know I played myself in retrospect
Givin' you the respect of a top choice select
On some "never again shit" I expect
I chalk it up to trial and error but I can't say I'm over it yet
Out of sight mind and body could've sworn you were the best of both worlds
in my eyes yo, you had no flaws
Then I learned it was to good to be true
so now my two favorite records are "Wildflower" & "Truly Yours" 
I can't front though, you had me for a second
I was caught up in your words overlookin' your ways
Truth was seen but not heard you was lyin' for days
just to find yourself lost in your own damn age
Now my vision's clarified like Windex
you get the peace sign without the index
From ex to next--too complex?
I'll translate: FUCK YOU
clean bill of health still I wish I never stuck you
Claim to be my Earth but you too trife
more like Mercury you came close but too hot to sustain life
So now ya cast out far out like Pluto
three strikes through ?? but the choosen few
So Imma tell ya like this....

(Chorus w/ scratch of "my dear my dear my dear you do not know me")
"You can get the third; 
eye or the leg or the finger if deferred
I know what's on ya mind so sis ya need to say the word
Eye or the leg or finger if deferred
Imma tell ya like this, you can get the third
eye or the leg or the finger if deferred
I know what's on ya mind so sis ya need to say the word
Eye or the Leg or the Bird (*scratching of "Passin' Me By"*)</pre>
