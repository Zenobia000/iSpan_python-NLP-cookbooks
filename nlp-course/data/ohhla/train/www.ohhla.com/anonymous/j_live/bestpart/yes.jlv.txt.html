It goes one for you, one for me
Two for you, one two for me
Three for you, one two three for me
Four for you, well let's see, yo

What you want, hot shit or dope shit? (Yes)
What you need, freedom or justice? (Yes)
What you like, light skin or dark skin? (Yes)
Who are you, the bomber or the marksman? (Yes)

It's the pinpoint accurate assassin in the bushes
On be two styles, wiping your spot off the map
It's the kamikaze with the parachute, live nigga rap
You don't want my fist caught in your mouth? Shut your trap
I heard you got a jones for keeping up with the Joneses
The only problem is, all your Jones is wack
This kid tried to tell me you the bomb (Word to mother)
Come to find out, he on your streets he want to cover
Well if that ain't debacle in the ghetto for the sea party
Smooth move, Ex-Lax, who said you ain't shit?
You need to come to grips with the fact that you're slipping
Shooting off the mouth but forgot to put your clip in
Meanwhile somewhere on the Eastside of side pat
Truly yours plotting like Nikki and the Brain
They have it both ways with the lying shin point
So show forth and prove who's the master in the game
That's why it goes

One for you, one for me
Two for you, one two for me
Three for you, one two three for me
Four for you, well let's see, yo

What you got, heads or tails? (Yes)
Street props or record sales? (Yes)
Who are you, God or a black man? (Yes)
Where your comp at, fire or the frying pan? (Yes)

Don't you see, my mentality is sort of like the boomerang effect
Over your head, but hit you in the back of your neck
Fucking with Live, who wins? What the fuck you expect?
That's like your girl tossing your salad to get your respect (Ewwww)
The kind of jobs ???? wouldn't volunteer for
Whether you T. Martin or Shamika Holdsclaw
Like playing chicken with a truck in the Red Shore
Quick draw, rip your, rap books to cole slaw
Break your, fake stain, glass jaw to jigsaw
Transform, make sure, hard facial make sure
With pure las-er, cut lyrical razor
Make sure, hate-ters, get what they paid for
Stay y'all CD, DJ, and MC's
Just I-C-E or L-I-B-E
Paperback bestseller or your cable TV
Make all I see, just why it must be, what?

One for you, one for me
Two for you, one two for me
Three for you, one two three for me
Four for you, well let's see, yo

What you want, hot shit or dope shit? (Yes)
What you need, freedom or justice? (Yes)
What you like, light skin or dark skin? (Yes)
Who are you, the bomber or the marksman? (Yes)

What you got, heads or tails? (Uh huh, uh huh)
Street props or record sales? (Yes)
Who are you, God or a black man? (Damn right)
Where your comp at, fire or the frying pan? (Yes)

What you cutting with, your left hand or your right hand? (Yes)
What you got, the right tools or the right blends? (Yes)
What your plant need, sunshine or watering? (Yes)
Where you going man, Japan or Maryland? (Yes)

How you getting there, subway or dollar van? (Yes!)
What you need to coincide your caravan? (YES!)
Where we eating, Pittsburgh or New Orleans? (YES!!!)
What you wanna keep that or record again? (YES!!!)

It goes one for you, one for me
Two for you, one two for me
Three for you, one two three for me
Four for you, well let's see (Hell no!)</pre>
