Artist: J-Live
Album:  Around the Sun 
Song:   Not Listening
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro]
You see the thing is..
I'm not even talkin about you if you're wack
If you're wack, you don't matter
But if you're dope, then it's like, I mean it's like waste of talent
You know what I'm sayin?
Alright when I say "sayin shit", y'all say "listening"
..Alright when I start sayin shit, y'all start listenin

[J-Live]
Yo, I was hearin this emcee, spittin this song
Rappin his ass off like twenty bars long
Voice was dope the beat was mad strong
Sample was chopped fresh but, somethin was wrong
It wasn't the flow, that shit was right on time
He was all up in the pocket, ridin the bassline
I was impressed by the words he chose to rhyme
It was in divine design, similar to mine
Like, "Man, why I never thought to use that before this?"
Really all in all, his rap style was flawless
But regardless, for some strange reason
I wasn't moved or compelled to laud or applaud this
Halfway through the song, I'm already bored with
And I hate to sound so matter-of-fact
It was definitely dope, certainly not wack
But there was something that lacked, let me rewind the track
Listen once, listen twice, listen three or four times
To the point, where I started to memorize the lines
I finally realize yeah homeboy could spit
But it just didn't matter cause he wasn't sayin shit

[Chorus]
See if y'all not sayin shit, I'm not listening
("Sayin shit" - "Listening", "Sayin shit" - "Listening")
When y'all stop sayin shit, I stop listening
("Sayin shit" - "Listening", "Sayin shit" - "Listening")

[J-Live]
See it's 2014, nah mean?
I feel like I done seen or heard it all in this rap scene
So, you can say it's mean but, see this look on my face?
If it was a meme, it'd be somewhere in between that
Condescending Wonka and the Skeptical African
Do you mean to tell me that we're talkin 'bout that again?
You on some next shit, really are you sure?
Stop me if you ain't never heard this before
Okay, you got on some jewelry, you push a nice ride
You really like the color of the leather inside
You grew up in the hood and you surprised you survived
You nice on the mic, top 10 dead or alive
You prefer pretty girls, especially thick
Coincidentally, that's the type that's on your dick
Your crazy misadventures are unique and bugged
Like remember that time you shot guns and sold drugs?
Your next album's about to change the game
The world's on notice to remember your name
You love where you live and that's where you get your style from
..How I just summed up your last three albums??

[Chorus]
Maaan, see if y'all not sayin shit, I'm not listening
("Sayin shit" - "Listening", "Sayin shit" - "Listening")
When y'all stop sayin shit, I stop listening
("Sayin shit" - "Listening", "Sayin shit" - "Listening")
Yo if I stop sayin shit, please stop listening
("Sayin shit" - "Listening", "Sayin shit" - "Listening")
Cause if y'all not sayin shit, I'm not listening
("Sayin shit" - "Listening", "Sayin shit" - "Listening")</pre>
