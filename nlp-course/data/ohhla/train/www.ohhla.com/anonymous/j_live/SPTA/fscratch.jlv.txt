[J-Live]
As I start from scratch, new thoughts and ideas hatch
From the mind of a madman too swift to catch
The experience, what brings and what makes
the experiments and leaves the earthquakes
A hibernatin giant awaits between breaks
That's so damn defiant he embrace mistakes
to rebound and go up as strong as it takes
No longer a lion on pumps and head fakes
He march to the beat of a drum they can't find
It's buried by muscle, and powered by mind
Perpetual motion like death begets life
and life begets death from first to last breath
Like right, that needs left to exist effective
Self-reflective, sharp in perspective
The objective - add on
for the selective collective as I start from scratch

[J-Live]
As I start from scratch, hands over box unlatched
The wrath of a ronin with skills that's unmatched
that no droid or clone in the world can withstand
They burn in the light of the original man
But unlike the phoenix they never rise again
Your immature zenith is like your wingspan
Your arms are too short for your master plan
cause you a slave to your master's plan - hot damn~!
Cold cold lesson, tough love
Old wounds, fresh dressings, never enough
for the eternal internal bleeding
when your greed supersedes your needs
It's a shame, the way you mess around with the art
The sheep in wolf's clothes that gets ripped apart
Attack! The self proclaimed leader of the pack
For you know now the alpha's back, as I start from scratch

[J-Live]
As I start from scratch, regardless of your watts son watch
You felt 'round the belt, lookin for the top notch
to end up somewhere between pocket and crotch
and jump to the next like you playin hopscotch
You fascinated by the unstoppable force
But never asked if it was on the right course
I stand on my square and no man can fudge it
The Poor Righteous Teachers, that transcend the budget
You come up from underground with bad roots, find shade
under trees you plant to bear fruit, stay paid
So what happened to trust and love? Songs promote, songs paid
Attribute, cameras salute, absolute, cascade
that started from a drop in the water
The ripple reach shores abroad and breach borders
and remove the chip all aboard these broad shoulders
with pleasures and tales untold, as I start from scratch
