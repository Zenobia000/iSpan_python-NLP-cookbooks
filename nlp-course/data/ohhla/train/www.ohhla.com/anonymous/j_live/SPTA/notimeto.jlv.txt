[Intro - J-Live - talking]
Yo, how you wanna do this, know what I'm sayin?
(Alright, so basically I'm a come in)
Alright, uh huh
(Basically we'll go back and forth with it, alright?)
Okay, good, good, got it
(That's gonna work out, that's how that works)
What's he gonna be doin?
(Once y'all get in where y'all want and I'm a come back in
and go over the whole thing, alright?)
Okay, bet, bet
(Exactly, teamwork)

[Verse 1 - J-Live]
Be not just said but heard, not just heard but seen
Not just seen but felt, behind your "nah means"
Be substance, beyond your "um, like ya knows"
Let's see your wise words form this constant flow
Be proof at the show, show proof of life
Captivate minds, eliminate strife
Decimate the trife like check but not mate
Real Kings move with ease, we block, move and take
The best food for thought, we grill like the Foreman
Build, upon blueprints, designs endurin
Time spans for lifetimes not seen the joinin
Meetings of minds that never get adjourned
That fuck with your head like octopus pores
And fire up synapsis, never found boring
See, my synopsis here is my drawing
All y'all to rise like the sun every morning (let's go)

[Chorus - J-Live]
I gotta spit like it's no time to waste
Spit like I can't stand the way this world tastes
Spit for rebellion, spit for resistance
Spit for accuracy, spit for distance

Spit like it's no time to waste
Spit like I can't stand the way this life tastes
Spit for survival, spit for existence
Spit for accuracy, spit for distance

[Verse 2 - J-Live]
We take heed when rivals cheat with the score
They tip the playing fields, we've seen this before
When opportunities knock and they lock the door
You unlock your barriers, headlock your doorman
Slide past security, strike without warning
Contact authorities, just to inform them
That the stat quo's been dubbed a swift blow
My people's asleep, it's been so long, dormant
Now I hold the keys to peepholes, explorin
Options, ways of means to insure them
Names are recorded, false claims retorted
Heroes allotted, jerks are reported
Deeds are applauded, works are rewarded
Food, clothes and shelter, all are afforded
Love, peace and happiness, pride in your nappiness
Plots to destroy your culture, give orders
See the self hate and doubt get deported
Beyond your borders, belay the orders
Delays and setbacks get drawn and quartered
Teach the lambs to repel that slaughter
Teach the horses to drink that water
Teach to build or destroy like mortar
And like muscle tissues get torn
Let's grow from these lessons stronger than before (let's go)

[Chorus]
