[J-Live]
Well if isn't the outbreak monkey for that latest epidemic of The Vapors
Bringing you the greatest live caper to date
To get involved, to marry to the music
Givin no quarter for those that would abuse it

Nah, not even a fuck and a dream, a Coke and smile
A smoke and a pancake, not a pat on the back and a handshake
For bein whack, shit is beyond hate
I'm evacuatin the state, you makin me glands ache

Me and my bags packed, the headphones are playin the soundtrack
My ears to your songs is like teeth to plaque, or
big speakers to feedback, quarterbacks to sacks
The bottom line nah we don't need that

Yo your shit is crack! In so much as
I never fuck with it and never will - never use, never deal
Never chopped, never cooked, and I really don't feel the appeal
How they get a record deal? For real

[Chorus]
It's the return of the supergood, the authentic
You might drama but we wouldn't recommend it
We shoot from the hip like, hip-hop's Doc Holiday
Zaggin up your Tombstone to say
that your songs are the worst, and you can't freestyle
So who's next to step? I'm the huckleberry now
You wanna test we? You must be crazy
You might be quick soon but you don't know D.A.I.S.Y.

[J-Live]
When I tell you I'm at least three deep dolo
I'm not referrin to the big and tall Polo; and I'm surely not braggin
on your girl, your toke moms or the Magnum - oh no
I'm much more classy and I wouldn't stoop so low

See, he's referrin to the royal we (the royal we~!)
The righteous, unholy trinity
No holes within at least 10 miles of the vicinity
except for the blast holes peerin through the innards of our enemies

Now - who all for and against, it makes sense
when you recognize the sides and don't straddle the fence
Let the good shit ride, let the bullshit be past tense
Long gone, no trace of evidence

Except! For perhaps the finger and footprints
(Where we stomped you and choked you out) or so it went
{So I heard} (so they say) {I guess} Nah, confess!
When we smack dab in the middle of the mess, cause

[Chorus]
