"Going in circles..."
{"Bongo Bombay"}

[Sha Sha] + (The Game)
I just want you to come home, no matter if it's late at night
(I hear you talkin)
I know you sayin you workin, but baby boy this feelin ain't right
(I'm just out here tryna get my money, you know that)
Fuck that we got enough houses, enough cars, you done bought me enough jewelry
Tired of your shit, my nigga you hear me
(You know I be at the studio and shit) Nigga you lyin
Who you tryin to run that game on? Who you think I am?
I'm not one of these THOT's you met at Playhouse
(I ain't say that) I just rode by nigga, you wasn't at Dre house
(Parked my shit at 'Ye house and hopped in the uber)
Jayceon, stop lyin, you fuckin think I'm stupid?

[The Game]
Nah look, ain't nobody say that, you ain't complain when I bought that Maybach
Put you in Chanel, your friend Chanelle can't even say that
You wanted to see Rihanna, I put you and your friends at the concert
Closet full of Giuseppes, you came a long way from Converse
Took you out that Hon-cord, put you in that Tom Ford
All this arguin I ain't got no time for it
You call my phone like, fifty times, don't do no shit like that
I was just fuckin them girls, I was gon' get right back

[Eric Bellinger]
Spinnin around, spinnin around
Spinnin around, spinnin around
It's the same old
We be goin through the same old
Spinnin around, spinnin around
Pullin 'em down, takin 'em down
It's the same old
Niggaz get tired of the same old

[Sha Sha] + (The Game)
Nigga you strappin up? (Yeah I'm strappin up)
(Shit, you actin up?) Yeah I'm actin up!
Nigga, you not gon' keep on playin me
You not gon' keep on playin me
Is it gon' be this bitch or your family?
I'll kill that bitch whole family
I fuckin hate you! {*blam*} (What your crazy ass shootin in the house for?!)
What yo' dumbass screwin in the house for?
And what time you get home anyway? (Shit, about four)
And that's what the fuck you sleepin on the couch for!

[The Game] + (Sha Sha)
I don't give a fuck, +Thug Life+, I'm an +Outlaw+
And the next bitch ain't nothin but a house call
Scrollin through my iPhone, lookin for my side chick
This bitch always flippin pushin buttons like a Sidekick
That's when I hop in my Jeep, and pull it up to toxic
(And while you gone, guess what? I'll be bouncin on that side dick nigga)

{*beat changes*}

[Sha Sha]
I guess you thought they stopped makin real niggaz when they made you
I guess you thought they stopped makin real niggaz when they made you
I guess you thought they stopped makin real niggaz when they made you

[Eric Bellinger]
Shit, they stop makin 'em, they stop makin 'em
{*scats*}
Guess you thought they stopped makin real bitches when they made you
Shit, there's a few in the room and a couple in the Wraith too
But you know you still the one

[Q-Tip]
And nothin could compare to the tappin that you hear
when you get caught in the stare at the next derriere
Now she's explaining to you
that she's the baddest bitch that ever graced a pair of shoes
And if you wanna gamble to find better, you lose
And all this loud chirpin that you, consider rude
But when food is on the table
We may be arguin like we Cain and we Abel
Then we have some makeup love and we get back stable
Have a little girl, I cut the cord from her navel

[Outro: Q-Tip] + (Eric Bellinger)
Hey, hey, hey, down, down
(I guess it's just the way it goes down, down, down)
Down, down, down, down, round, round, round, round
(Love is like a merry-go-round, round, round)
Down, down, down, down, down, round, round, round, round
(I guess it's just the way it goes down, down, down)
Down, down, down, down, round, round, round, round
(Love is like a merry-go-round, and on goes the game)</pre>
