Artist: Missy Elliott f/ Slick Rick
Album:  The Cookbook
Song:   Irresistible Delicious
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[over the melody of Slick Rick's song "Lick the Balls"]

[Slick Rick]
It's entertainment time!!!!  Wooo
Got Missy Elliott in the house, got Slick Rick in the house
We doin big things here kids
Hip-Hop's finest, Slick Slick Slick Rick an' M
[scratched] Slick Rick an' M
Go Missy, go Missy, go Missy, go Missy
[scratched] Slick Rick an' M

[Missy Elliott]
Excuse me Mr. Lawrence, you look nice
Simply delicious, Missy want some kisses
Let's go to the crib, get cozy in the nude
And "Treat Me Like a Prostitute"
Now pardon me sir, I'm such a real lady
Ride in Mercedes to make the bitches hate me
Cruise up and down one-two-fifth
Lookin for a guy like you to get with
	{*beat changes*}
I seen this cutie pie, so I pulled beside him
Seen the size of his feet, so I couldn't deny him
Might as well try him, the freak that I am
M dot S-E always grindin'

[Missy - singing]
Please don't think I'm crazy (oooooh)
But boy you are supa fine (do it to me, do it to me)
[Slick Rick] Thank you Missy
Irresistible delicious (oooooh) HOLLA
Enough to make me lose my mind
[Slick Rick] Yeah
Know I really want it
[scratched] Slick Slick Slick Rick an' M
Now I want it, yeah
Don't make me wait oh no - no don't make me wait oh no
[Slick Rick] Missy
No longer will I pretend
[Slick Rick] Slick Rick in the house
Let's get it on cause we both grown

[Slick Rick]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
	{*beat changes back*}
Intelligent, delicate, watch how the fella get
Bump into my homegirl in Miami, Missy Elliott
Green blush on her eyelid, hi Miss!
Gave honey a hug I feel her touchin my privates
Aw shuck I guess, main course is in I said
You know I'm married?
-- Yeah and what's that supposed to mean?
-- Proposition for you Ruler
Procede on
-- Well I got a track I need you spit a mean 16 on
-- You with it?
Down to bless one and I left one
The Hit Factory, later on around eleven
With my notebook, and pencil, I slides on in
I see her lookin mighty sexy and the lights all dim
-- Have a drink
The booze and the karmy go oddly
After havin a drink I start to feel unusually horny
Swellin stone, or well writ poems
Busy poundin like I'm tryin to break off pelvis bones

	{*beat changes*}

[Missy - singing]
Please don't think I'm crazy (oooooh)
[Slick Rick] Slick Rick is in the house
But boy you are supa fine (do it to me, do it to me)
[Slick Rick] Thank you Missy
Irresistible delicious (oooooh) HOLLA
Enough to make me lose my mind - lose my mind
Know I really want it - and now I want it
Don't make me wait oh no - no don't make me wait oh no
No longer will I pretend
[Slick Rick] Boss of the females
Let's get it on cause we both grown
[Slick Rick] Recognize, recognize

	{*beat changes back*}

[Missy Elliott]
Excuse me sir, oh gosh you look young
But old enough to get it to get yo' head sprung
Sit down relax, it's soft here on my couch
Or give me hands strictly you might get turned out
Cutie pie, 'til I sit beside him
Nice shoe size, how could I deny him
Big bankroll to help me retire
Me and him together smell like big empire
Don't treat me like a prostitute
Unless you're givin me some money makin sure I look cute
But don't treat me like a prostitute
Unless you're givin me some money makin sure I look cute

[Missy - singing]
Please don't think I'm crazy (oooooh)
[scratched] Please don't think I'm crazy (oooooh)
[scratched] But boy you are supa fine (do it to me, do it to me)
[scratched] Fi-fi-fine
