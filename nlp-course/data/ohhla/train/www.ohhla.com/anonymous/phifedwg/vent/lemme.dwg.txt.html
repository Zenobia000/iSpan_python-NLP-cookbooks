Song:   Lemme Find Out
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

Yo Pete, run that

[ VERSE 1 ]
Growin up I used to use the Afro Sheen
Knicks and Lakers was my favorite basketball teams
Underground MC, but I can bring it mainstream
Rap style being seen like muthafuckin Tom Greene
In the immortal words of Rakim, I'm a microphone fiend
Trini say 'yes, Jamaica say 'seen'
(Hold it down) gotta hold it down for Queens
(Recognize) (my name is Phife)
People still takin rappin for a joke
All they know is chips, whips, dank, hoes and smoke
What we need is raw peoples who will practice they craft
Goin hard to the extreme, why would you go half-assed?
Call me the Cal Ripken of the industry (Carl who?)
Seen rappers shine, as well as seen some hang their head in misery
No matter what whoever said, I stuck with it
Stay committted, hence the reason competition stay gettin shitted
On - what - I've held shit in for so long
(Go 'head, Phife, get your man on)
Reminiscin 'bout them school lunch tables I used to bang on
Run-D.M.C. at M.S.G. gettin they shine on
Knowin one day I'd get that chance, yo
And the reward wasn't just dough, it was when people hit the danceflo'
A way with culture lyrics or shorties singin "Can I kick it?"
Yeah, that's the ticket, go 'head, show me your Tribe spirit
Man listen, I'm here to tell it
Success was bound to come, how I know? I can smell it
Phife be sharper than an arrow
Equivalent to Pete Rock or Primo collectin vinyl
Cause it's all about the love, yo
Battle whoever whenever, let's get it on, yo
Bust that ass like no tomorrow
Just to keep the flows up to par
But nowadays none of you maggots would like to spar
But here I are, 10 years in the cut
Five albums, did three of em dope, two of them ( *disgusted sound* ) - and such and such
But like they say, a true champ, he always rises
Phife Dawg, Da LP, full of surprises

(Lemme find out)
Y'all niggas ain't got no clout
(Lemme find out)
Y'all niggas got my name in your mouth
(Lemme find out)
Them labels lately puttin shit out
(Lemme find out)
Ah-ha
(Lemme find out)
Ah-ha
(Lemme find out)
You want me to come blow up the spot
(Lemme find out)
Y'all niggas is all in the cot
(Lemme find out)
You don't know about Pete Rock
(Lemme find out)
Ah-ha
(Lemme find out)
Ah-ha
(Lemme find out)

[ VERSE 2 ]
On my way to the club better known as One-Tweezy
Where you find them fake ballers and some hoes lookin sleazy
The place where robbin a nigga is so easy
Same club where strippers go, I think I found one to ease me
1:30 in the morning, taking it easy
This one dude's all in my shit, for a sec I thought I had tits, gee
I overheard him saying that my rap style was pussy
I'm nothin on my own, the rest were better without me
I couldn't comprehend, he said it under his breath
But when I did, no hesitation, to my business I stepped
What you say? Excuse me? Pardon? Oh, don't be a bitch, sucker
Now you wanna act shy? You know my name, muthafucka
Straight pussy nigga, oh now it's what, you don't know?
Believe me man, you can get that ass bust for sho'
Just because a nigga rappin, what you think it can't happen?
What the deal, you wanna dance? We can get straight to scrappin
Hm, I'm sayin Pete, you know the drilly, black (No doubt, son)
New York is to the fullest, we don't know how to act
But on a professional level, should I deal with this?
Like the Goodie Mob say, I'm too real for this
Work too muthafuckin hard for this, used to lie, cheat, steal for this
An innovator when it comes to this
Feed my fam with this, put clothes on they back with this
Bust my ass to be a part of this
Livin my life with this
Makin people straight rejoicin this
Aw fuck it, I'm so nice with this
I make your broad drop her drawers for this
Slit her wrist for this, and now what, punk, bitch
But fuck it yo, I ain't trippin
I know a asshole when I see one, just don't get caught slippin
So what the fuck now, nigga?
Yo, suck on ???? right here, in my pants, behind my zipper

(Lemme find out)
Y'all niggas ain't got no clout
(Lemme find out)
Y'all niggas got my name in your mouth
(Lemme find out)
Them labels lately puttin shit out
(Lemme find out)
What
(Lemme find out)
What
(Lemme find out)
You want me to come blow up the spot
(Lemme find out)
Y'all niggas is all in the cot
(Lemme find out)
You don't know about Pete Rock
(Lemme find out)
Ah
(Lemme find out)
Ah
(Lemme find out)

Yo
2000
2001, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Till 2000-bombaclaat-30
Ya hear me
Live life
Live long
Stay strong
I'm out
(No doubt, son)</pre>
