Artist: Phife Dawg
Album:  Ventilation: Da LP
Song:   Tha Club Hoppa
Typed by: Tha Lyricz Finisha

[Intro: Phife Dawg]
One time, two times, three times, four times
West coast, east coast, up north, down south
Like Akinyele say, put it in your mouth

[Phife Dawg]
Thank God it's Friday, where's my check? Time to party
Phife night, I'm inviting, everybody
Celebs galore, which will make the shorty's come out
Ass anonymous, once I'm single, time to dumb out
Club Amnesia, Miami, had to rent it out
Celebration, new LP, bout to put it out
Up in Chicago, House of Blues, bout to turn it out
Ladies get in free with my CD, that's what I'm talking bout
New York City, The Tunnel, where niggas move wit clout
Come to the jam wit ya man, you get escorted out
This the function, guaranteed you leaving hobble
Same goes for all them herbs with empty Moet bottles
Magic City, Club Nicky, soon to follow
Then it's gentleman's club, word life, and in tomorrow
Club Evolution, Illadelph, oh my God, yo
Mary time whore, catching wreck out in 'Frisco
Big mouth chicks, to shut 'em up, we make 'em swallow
Diggy Dawg, Rick Rock, what a combo
On a cheese mission, like Wisconsin, feel me Pablo?
Legendary, like that phantom on that Apollo

[Chorus: Phife Dawg (girl)]
Heard there's a party going on in here
Well let me shake my stinking ass in here
Well alright (alright) well alright (alright)
The Diggy Dawg give it to you all night
Heard there's a party going on in here
Well let me shake my stinking ass in here
Well alright (alright) well alright (alright)
The Phife Dawg give it to you all night

[Phife Dawg]
I'm touching down in H-Town, Club Jamaica Jamaica
They know the flavor, all ladies watch your behavior
The Phife Dawg, 2000's Captain Save-a
I illuminate, shedding light like the creator
I illustrate, clarify, peep these examples
Example 1, all tricks, Diggy will trample
Example 2, my attitude be F.U.
Example 3, the hell ya'll can do for me?
Example 4, always protected never raw
Example 5, ahh shucks, never mind
Now what the deal, ma, is it real, well certainly
I got another show, Steak Theater out in the D
Aiyo yo Rick Rock, don't stop, keep this here moving
We gots to win, I don't take well to losing
Up in D.C. live, where the owner makes a killing
Like a block of ice, no doubt, we steady chilling
Tig bitties shaking, Jazzy T's, asses grooving
Getting my back rubbed, amongst other things, damn it's so soothing
After party, Swiss Hotel, only for women
There groupies get the finger, no doubt, that's how we living
Some brothers puff a weave, just so they ass can get it
Come out my space, slam the door, right in they face
I'm saying, what, it's my seed that you can duck
MC's will get crushed with these flows I conduct

[Chorus]

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
All my ladies say "owww" fellas say "ho"
Do-that-do-that-do-do-that-that-that
All my ladies say "owww" fellas say "ho"
Do-that-do-that-do-do-that-that-that
All my ladies say "owww" fellas say "ho"
Do-that-do-that-do-do-that-that-that
Now all my ladies say "owww" fellas say "ho"
Do-that-do-that-do-do-that-that-that</pre>
