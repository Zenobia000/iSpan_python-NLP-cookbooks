Miscellaneous shit baby, meanin..
I'll make you wanna..

[Hook]
Rock to the joint, roll up a joint
Bust shots to the joint, Spike Lee to the joint
Bounce to the joint, screw to the joint
(Say what?) Yeah, you know it's on point (uh huh)

Just vibe to the joint, ride to the joint
Bump 'n grind to the joint, then skate to the joint
Now slide to the joint, act wild with a joint
Huh, once again it's on point, come on (here we go!)

[Verse One: Phife Dawg]
Party over here, fuck y'all over there
Drinks on Malik, ya live once, I don't care
Love the night life like Sonny love Cher
Bound to take a shorty home, put her ass in the air
Look at Miss Thingy, I heard she type pissy
One that'll have simple ways, that'll block and get busy
Fat Joe, Pun said it's all about trizzies
Spit the game in her ear, in the coatcheck chick
Had to give it to her, came out, pull out my zipper
Now I'm like "WHOA" cause her come my baby father
Shit money big, now I think I'm gonna need back up
He walked right next to me and smacked her ass up
WHOO that's a close one, here let me bounce
Third floor, gotta see who else is in the house
Up north, reppin with these chicks from down South
Shorty sippin Hennesey, singin 'put it in your mouth'

[Hook]
Rock to the joint, roll to the joint
Bust shots to the joint, Spike Lee to the joint
Bounce to the joint, screw to the joint
Uh, you know it's on point (no doubt)

Vibe to the joint, ride to the joint
Bump 'n grind to the joint, unwind to the joint
Slide to the joint, act wild to the joint (yeah)
You know it's on point, c'mon!

[Verse Two: Phife Dawg]
On towards chillin, now we at the after party
Com' Sense, Mos Def, fuck it - everybody!
Fuck chillin at the tele, I'm scoopin me a hottie
Chillin load of girls, and those shorties lookin sloppy
Came to the door, made the dancefloor wild
Shorties "Sayin My Name" like Destiny's Child (aah)
So I just smile, get em thirsty like 'ow'
I know I'm type foul, trippy steady on a pile
Eyes wide open like a motherfuckin owl
Who's this tig bitty chick with the Colgate smile?
Said her name was Tafy, with nose by to act me
Straight from St. Louis, said she'd love to do me
Smacked on her ass as if she worked at Big Skippy
Wanted to give my neck a hicky, but something 'bout her's tricky
Looked at the bar, oh shit it couldn't be!
The J to the A to the N to the E
You don't understand? Ask EPMD!
Thinkin to myself, goddammit why me?
Thinkin to myself, goddammit why me?
Thinkin to myself, goddammit why me?

[Hook]
Rock to the joint, roll to the joint
Bust shots to the joint, Spike Lee to the joint
Bounce to the joint, screw to the joint
Uh, you know it's on point (no doubt)

Now vibe to the joint, ride to the joint
Bump 'n grind to the joint, unwind to the joint
Slide to the joint, act wild to the joint
You know it's on point (no doubt, no doubt)

[Outro]
You know it's on point (no doubt)
You know it's on point (no doubt)
You know it's on point (on point..)</pre>
