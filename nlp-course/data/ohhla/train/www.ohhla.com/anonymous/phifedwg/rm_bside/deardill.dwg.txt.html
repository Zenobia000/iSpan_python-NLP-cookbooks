[Intro: Phife]
Dilla Dawg..
Had a dream about you, fam
It's 2005, we in the same hospital room
You on one side, I'm on the other
I'm stressed out, but what gave me motivation 
was you pullin out that MP, and bangin out some bangers as usual
Nothin ever fade you, fam, and for that, I miss you
("Let's go!" <- J Dilla)

Dear Dilla ("Yeah! Yeeeeaah!")
Yeah.. ("Uh!) D-Town, throw it up
("Turn it up!") Yeah NYC, throw it up
("Yeah! Yeeeeaah!") The whole world throw it up
Peep game ("Uh!")

[Phife Dawg]
+Hold Tight+, this ain't the last I'ma see you
In due time, that's my word, I'ma see you
Frontin-ass rappers down here still an issue
Posin like they hard when we know they all see-through
I'ma tell you Dilla why they lackin skills, pal
No stage presence, cadence, style
They livin off of hooks, skinny jean crooks
Pre-K lyrics - bwoy, gwan on read a book!
I reminisce, reminisce, when Mobb dropped "Shook"
Shan was +Down By Law+, such a good look
Nas +God's Son+, his return was +Stillmatic+
Roots' +Distortion to Static+, you and Slum +Fantastic+
Thought I shout you out son, see how you're doin
Come back to earth homie, hip-hop is in ruins
I'm a third of the Tribe but I'ma speak for the clique
WHATTUP DOE? We miss you kid, Mo' city say

[Chorus: cuts and scratches by DJ Rasta Root]
"Jay Dee flip another beat for me" <- Q-Tip
{*"Get This Money" by Slum Village beat*}
"Jay Dee flip another beat for me" <- Q-Tip
{*"Raise It Up" by Slum Village beat*} "Turn it up" <- Dilla
"Jay Dee flip another beat for me" <- Q-Tip
{*"Dollar (Let the Dollar Circulate)" by Steve Spacek beat*}
"Jay Dee flip another beat for me" <- Q-Tip
{*"Let's Ride" by Q-Tip beat*}

[Phife Dawg]
Yo yo, beat wise, you still that cat which most shouldn't be measured
I'm that emcee known as year's displeasure
With the route the game has taken, how mundane things have gotten
Y'know, music on the whole, never mind just hip-hoppin
I'm in the club three hours and change
DJ spinnin Top 40, tracks we be hearin all day
Some emcees with catalogue, ay yeah they stay paid
But why pay over one buck, when they lip-syncin on stage?
King of Pop, Barry White rollin over in they grave
Jones Girls, Emotions sayin, "Girl, +Back in Our Day+.."
Dilla, dudes still bitin you, they wish to be like you
Producer extraordinaire, knowin them beats be recycled
But on your worst day, they couldn't mess with you
Cats makin cheese, in remembrance of you
Least they can do is give your fam a dime or two
This man gave his heart, this what the 'uck y'all do??
But yo, don't stress mi yout, word bond we got you!
Tell Baatin I said waddup, word he right next to you?
From NYC to the D, with heavy hearts we miss youu
Word GOD wish you were here, so until we meet again, just...

[Chorus: cuts and scratches by DJ Rasta Root]
"Jay Dee flip another beat for me" <- Q-Tip
{*"Find a Way" by A Tribe Called Quest beat*}
"Jay Dee flip another beat for me" <- Q-Tip
{*"Climax (Girl Shit)" by Slum Village beat*}
"Jay Dee flip another beat for me" <- Q-Tip
{*"The Light" by Common beat*}
"Jay Dee flip another beat for me" <- Q-Tip
{*"Players" by Slum Village beat*}

{DJ Rasta Root cuts and scratches}
"DILLA, DILLA" <- MF DOOM "Yeah"
"Do it" "Cause you know how we do"
"Turn it up another notch"
"Dilla" "Bounce in your whip"

[Outro: Phife Dawg]
Let 'em know, Ma Dukes...
V.Rich on the keys, my main man DJ Rasta Root's on the beat
("Uh, hold tight <- Q-Tip)
And the cuts, smokin needles, little kicks
Salute, ATCQ forever</pre>
