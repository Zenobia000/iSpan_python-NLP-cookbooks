Artist: Large Professor f/ Nas
Album:  Stay Chisel (Promo CDS)
Song:   Stay Chisel (Solo Version)
Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Chorus)
Stay chisel like a box of wife-beater by a Fila
Lou Ferrigno Arnold Schwarzenegger type steelo
Stay chisel, check your paper nigga
Bring the bardy of chess, then push it up harder than the rest
Stay chisel, precisely cup, sharp the fuck
You thought this was a game we came to charge you up
So take it to the brain, laid peoples, know how throw them things
Swift on them toes, knockout blow, so stay chisel

[Large Professor]
Ayo Nas?, I was telling them niggas on the ave.
the same shit the other day  (right)
Kids gotta stay sharp (no doubt) or stay chisel (chisel)

[Nas]
Yo, performing chest naked, I'm looking sharp for the peoples
Not in my physical form, strong thoughts, I'm cock-diesel
Brolic with knowledge so flow with me
Intelligence benching, four thousand & four fifty
Light a Dumbbell L, Inhale then hear the lunch bell ring
Sweating, working up her appetite, setting
Mental calisthenics got my mind stretching, then I release it
Have my whole frame bulging under diamond pieces
Take the weight of the world on my shoulders, I hold it
So I consume most of pain for my niggas that I roll with
'Cause see the streets ain't no GOLD'S GYM, papi
And if I feel it going down then my niggas'll spot me
Without the mind the body weight don't even mean nothing
Let's take three brothers and put them in the being or something
Who's gon' survive the wise man, the fool or the warrior?
Well if all of their minds are chisel, then all of them

(Chorus)

[Nas]
I stayed proper from my head to my feet
I did the red meat, the best sweet
I dated stressful chicks so now I'm stress-free
Cause life's too short for heartache
Let's fucking party, buy trucks and Ferraris
Driving across the globe, why not?
Sick of the same spot, move to the next
It's real niggas everywhere, bigger business plans
Bigger connects, every woman to one man, it's ten to one
Without the feeling of someone
making you scared to get up and run 
It's called escaping, the mental raping
How could the mind grow when you stagnant
around dude's who're too slow, my brother's trifling
Pushing cars the color of lightning
Read the writing in my skin... it spells GOD'S SON
There always be another coming up 
A killer got a mom son, that's why his luck is never running up
She praise for him, his taking over you position love
Doing what you use to do, being who you was

(Chorus)

[Nas]
Reduce fat rap, no calories in my mentality
No sugar no starch, the pull-ups is hard but get money
Breathe out your nose, start with light weights
Wheat bread instead no carbohydrates
Building my stamina, I'ma rep for the hood
Plum less now my stomach stretch from the grub
Good living, good women, them sex is straight stallions
Bow-leg stances, go'head handsome
Knuckle game, it's like Rubin Hurricane 
Dance to the music for the brain
Y'all dudes will never see me down
Reading everything, books and body language
Du Bois, Baldwin, and Chavis
Assata, John Hope Franklin, Angela Davis
Keep your chest up, head straight, eyes to the center
In your worst situation, gotta rise you a winner
So if I'm down to my last dime, cowards will never know
'Cause yo my shit is solid, remember yo

(Chorus)</pre>
