Artist: Black Eyed Peas f/ Cee-Lo, John Legend, Q-Tip, Talib Kweli
Album:  Monkey Business
Song:   Like That
Typed by: enginurd@hotmail.com

Wow, we in stereo?

[Q-Tip]
Question for the ages
What's going on with my rap pages?
Rappers wanna be down, but listen listen
You got to feel it within your body and your spirit
When you listen to the rhythm, come on
It's the abstract, Will is on the beat
Women all around the globe, the world
You got to follow me
Change your history, categories
Different people in the same territories
Hip-hop in there for my Black Eyed Peas
So watch it watch it, be marvelled of the speakers please
Cuz they gonna rumble and shake the ground
Break addles break the sound
Fill the embassful pound
Streets with the things profound
If you wanna, dude, to help you out
Make it cool around your friends without smoking now
Play the song kinda loud, it could help you out
And you could work it out, yeah you could work it out
It's like that, and a

[Chorus]
And we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
It's like that, like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Yeah we got it like that (like that)

It's like that cuz I got it like that

[Will.I.Am]
And I got it like that also
Got a style that's way out like Bosto
You know I'ma crook a nigga like Chocko
Steady jumpin' round like it's heavy cargo
(Can I kick it?) Yup, really far though
From El Segundo to Toronto
I once hit a girl up in Chicago
But I'd never say who unless my name was Tonto
Yup, you know how the date rape go
Cuz we show the classic example
Now they know the Peas collect the dough
So they knocking on our door like we was Fargo
Yup, they see me in a Will.I.Am suit
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have the loot
And I don't smoke herbs but I'm still real nice with the verbs
So FUCK (hey!) what you heard
Cuz we got it like that

[Chorus]

Talib, just hit 'em like that

[Talib Kweli]
I'm from the jungle, brother, and I got it like that
Yo, my life got me running through a maze like a white rat
I need a shot at remmy (martin) like my
Rappers like to yack is the fights that got me spillin' on the right track
And I like this, Will, so I might get ill
On the mic somebody might get killed
So many damn rappers there's a cypher in heaven
My tongue is a weapon and plus when I bust, its the stuff of Legend
When this Brooklyn MC come after you
You be running like I herd o'cattle down Mertle Avenue
Where we at ain't nothin pretty that's the attitude
To be at Fight Club, even Brad had to crack a tooth
Stare into the Sun, they try to copy
Let your eyes get used to the light because you gotta watch me
Sneak up on you like saki
My lyrics get out a split atoms like Hiroshima and Nagasaki

[Apl.de.Ap]
It's the Apl.De.Ap in the lab with the rap
Demonstrate how we act, we attack any track
It's the Black Eyed Peas and we back with the facts
Start with the fat skills that rose in the past
We got it like how you know how to beast rocks
Entertain you, see you soon at the next spot
The crew got you bouncing and dropping your eye
Making ???nah hot shish and be shocking them out???
Tss tsss tsss, I'ma roll with the hot
I'ma flow from the soul when you can't hold me back
Ke-ke-keep on keep on rolling the track
I'ma simply simply always attach
Jeepny music from by Apl.De.Ap
From L.A to Philippines we bridging the gap
We got it like that you know we got it like that
We got it like... like we got it like that y'all

[Chorus]

It's like that and a... [11x]
Because I got it like that

[Taboo]
My man Q-Tip in the house
Cee-lo ya you know he's in the house
My man John Legend's in the house
Talib Kweli work it out
My man Apl.De's in the house
Will.I.Am is definitely in the house
Fergie Ferg's in the house
Whadup to De La, shout 'em out
True hip-hop music now
Positive vibes, no doubt
My man Phife-dog's in the house
My man Shaheed's in the house
Taboo, You know I'm in the house
Black Eyed Peas represent sellin out [3x]

[outro - 3x]
It's like that and a...
It's like that and a...
It's like that or th-that
It's like that and a...

Because I got it like that</pre>
