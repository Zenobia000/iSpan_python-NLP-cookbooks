I'm gonna take you there
Adjust your gear and brace yourself
Cause my force is severe when the bassline kicks
My brain starts to twitch
Lyrics are woven like thread as I stitch together
A commentary more than clever
Rough and durable fit for any weather
See it's not me to sound mediocre
Picture the Guru comin' off like a joker
No instead i'll smoke ya
Light me like fireworks city dweller
The streets is where I lurk and I don't sweat the limelight
My folks know I'm hype and sucka rappers need to rhyme right
So you can call me the equalizer with my elite speech
You'll all know I'm wiser
Some emcees are fads and that's a drag
But I'm genuine and DJ Krush is a b-boy mastamind

B-boy mastamind, one of the greatest of all time
Truly the game never lame or mundane
It's a shame the way some do rap
With the mad corny tracks and the lines that are wack
But beware cause I'm here to testify
Lit up against me even the best'll fry
You know not fish or chicken til they get nice and crisp
And learn respect or then i'll have to dismiss 'em
Which one'll be next to meet the slayer
Yes the payer of dues the super cool rhymesayer
You gets no wins
You get dropped like bowling pins
I wonder but look how deep you're in
Now there's no turnin' back
You better come attack
Quit the phony crap or I'ma flip like billy jack
I use my mic like a bat or a stick
And bash every single emcee that's counterfeit
You can fool some people some of the time
But who you trying to kid with those played out rhymes
This ain't no joke, it's an art
And punk rappers fake hard when they got no heart
But a true b-boy knows the real stuff
I don't have to fantasize and tell lies to feel tough
I got more rhymes than new york's got crimes
Why, cause I'm a b-boy mastamind

My styles universal
In a battle, i'd hurt you
You ain't got enough skills to even enter my circle
You can try to compete but if the flow is weak
You'll end up on the floor flat out on the concrete
I never ever thought about losin'
Cause chumps I'm abusin', and microphones I'm bruisin'
I get charged, I done leavin' rappers scarred
Suckas should be barred, yo I'm pullin their cards
I'm sick and tired of these copycat rap acts
Bitin' concepts and frontin with knapsacks that's wack
Because they know they aren't fly
After this year, kiss their careers goodbye
And I will remain being real 
Cause when I rock, I got more strength than Seal
Feel the pressure that I release
It's kind of like the gunpowder in my piece
Ya beggin me and Krush to spare ya
Cause we take mad respect when we're in your area
And you know we won't be lettin' up
And after we hit ya, yo you won't be gettin up
I'm wettin up, each and every sucka crew
Chumps make one record then start to act new
I'ma burn ya with a slower or faster rhyme
You can't test a b-boy mastamind
