   Verse
   
   [Q-Tip]
   
   In this American metropolis filled with MC's
   A Tribe Called Quest came to drop jewels wit' ease
   Plus make you party, we do this music thing for everybody
   Black, White, Latino and Asian, we cold raisin'
   The stakes of hip-hop to a new plateau
   To bridge gaps in generations for future plantations
   A god-fearin' folk cos we all from the yolk
   Of one breed, one seed, to good goals we proceed
   Nowadays I strive to be a very good influence
   Even though not too long ago I was a truant
   Now I'm droppin' it on this and many broad topics
   From man's obsession with money to holy prophets
   Like Mohammed, yo, you know the scene is so freaky
   Enemies they denounce me and my own try to sweep me
   Now I got hip-hop acts posin' like fat cats
   Lex and a Rolex, Moet and a top hat
   But what about your contract, slick? Is you proper?
   It's time we turned the tables of this hip-hop fable
   I be strivin yo', tryna bang these joints out my skillet
   And fulfil it, think about these kids, we can't kill it
   
   [Phife]
   
   Now every dog has his day, but eff that, it's my year
   All you gat pullin' MC's could never come near
   All that bogus type chatter, please put it to rest
   It's the Phifer from Quest leavin' venues a mess
   So I even start to (Rap) when you know you have no (Haps)
   Wit' your simpleton (Lyrics), your light-hearted (Act)
   Step back, me no have no time for dat
   I'm blowin' up the spot for all you ras clot idi-ots
   In a world where you have like a zillion MC's
   Ninety percent of all you suckers have filthy LPs
   Bitch this, trick that, come on, act like you know
   I be that up north MC who never chose to play the down-low
   (His name is Phife Dawg) I label myself as The Boss (True dat)
   Same height as Little Vicious, yet I'm shorter than Kriss Kross
   Queens representation, son, you know how we do
   While Light' and Sha, they represent BK to the fullest
   I be the sidekick to The Abstract, so get ready for combat
   Yo, what about about them biters? Errr! Me not like that
   My motto is to wreck shop, I do it on the non-stop
   Come on party people, you must give me my props
   Cos y'all know good and damn well that the style has been mastered
   So head for the border you peasy-haired bastards
   Before I start to put it on ya, come on now, must I warn ya?
   Queens is in the house so all MC's go hold their corner
   
   Outro
   
   We feelin' pressures in here
   You know we feelin' pressures
   Feelin' pressures in here
   You know we feelin' pressures
   We gotta stand clear
   Jus' gotta stand clear
   Gotta gotta stand clear of the pressure
   The what?
