You know I look for trouble but trouble didn't follow me
All I wanted to be was an iller MC
Ever since nigga small as I grew up in Queens
What did you mosh of the Nontall (Holla Me!)
I turned my best friend Quaturem em head what I'd seen
And ever since that day (y'll hear me) things been a mess
R&B goes to rocky, true I tell and bless
So nowadays I go and see wifey just to kill me from stress
Lay my head on her breast, sugar definitely knows best
Explaining all my problems to her, gettin things off my chest
A lil hug up squeez up and no more I vent
Aiyo Sunny, without my peeps I'd be truely assed out
Making sure I have my lettercations so I wouldn't pass out
Native Tongues for believing in me when everyone was fessing
Most of Ja Mighty for the guidance and the blessings

Chorus: Faith Evans

I really know how it feels to be stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually
 (*32 seconds between*)

I really know how it feels to be stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually
Come on baby we gonna make it
Come on baby we gonna make it
Come on baby we gonna make it
We gonna make it
Come on baby we gonna make it
Baby we gonna make it
Come on baby we gonna make it
We gonna make it
Come on baby we gonna make it (ohhhh)
Come on baby we gonna make it (Gonna make it)
Come on baby we gonna make it (ohhhhh)
We gonna make it
Come on we gonna make it (ohhh)
I know were gonna make it (We're gonna make it)
Come on baby we gonna make it (Gonna  make it)
We gonna make it (Ohhh yeah)
Come on baby we gonna make it (Yeahhh baby)
We gonna make it (Gonna make it)
We gonna make it (Yeahhh)
I know were gonna make

Gonna make it
We gotta make it (Oh yeahhh)
You know we gotta make it</pre>
