Artist: A Tribe Called Quest f/ Rah Digga 
Album:  The Jam EP 
Song:   Mardi Gras at Midnight 
Typed by: SKrachVYnl@aol.com 

[Q-Tip] 
African American with the power, just tapped in to the cultural gin 
That be swalloin our minds, whole, but yo must it 
Empty ass rappers get me fueled and disgusted 
Can't even kick a rhyme about yourself properly 
Listen man I'll show you why you ain't toppin me 
Apitamy a levelheadedness 
Whose concern is how ill I come off and how that ill that I dress 
I don't, hit you with a whole bunch of bullshit 
On the microphone I keep my pros fluid 
Speakin to them people and the Tounges and Native 
Not with an ego that's anti-creative 
Concious to the fact that I'm a talented lad 
Make your move at a jam and feel better when sad 
Hey, "asalaam alaikum" to them firm true believers 
Hope yall pretty good as the message reciever 
Cause yo we got to take things in-to our own hands 
And be aware of these dangerous, plentiful lands 
That we exist within and combat and shake on 
But do it over Tribe because Tribe is the bomb 
We get through, especially if you got my back 
The Abstract use machete cuttin down on slab 
And we do it like this, rarely do we miss 
Catch you in the chest with an egale claw fist 
And back you, get it two by four and she'll lack you 
Tip you only find a nigga now that out raps you 
Or gets at you, and insists that you do it 
Cause you make it smooth and you make it like fluid 

[Q-Tip](Rah Digga){chorus} 
Sometimes I just be wonderin 
How these cats be com-in IN 
.......... 
I think we need to rectify this right? 
(And show these muthafuckas how we Mardi Gras) 

(Rah Digga) 
The name's Digga and I'm on, a mission to be larger 
Than them crackers that be running Time Warner [That's-right] 
I take it further, even runnin' shit in Persia 
With acquisitions and merges 
"You takin' me?" I might have you stressin 
"Your rap styles clear," but I'm the only danger pressin 
Rah lyrics with "UMMAH" productions 
Be "phater" than a chick that had liposuction 
They wasn't ready, for that which came 
T'was a slim little hunny after the fat bitch sang 
I break it down like quadratic equations 
You luke warm, my shit hotter than cajuns 
[Lacin]Stop, you ain't even worth my while 
Mama boy tryin to play it like he motherless child 
The whole rap industry is another evil 
They play enough times then I just might believe you 
Heads was still rhymin glock with glock 
I was puttin shit together phater than T. Shirley murda 
Ain't nuthin but a buncha, thornes in my side like you was acupuncture 
Bust it, playin post with me? that's unruley 
No matter how loose you'll still be a muley 
It's Rah Digga from the O-U-T's 
Having bullshit rappers going "Whoa it's" me 

[Q-Tip] 
We domonstrate MC and their music 
Laced with the real P-funk you must choose it 
We Buck Rogers, aiyyo we sun you like Twiggie 
Girls be like (he's jiggy), and they friends be like (who is he?) 
Mastering the mic like Jordan with the pill 
Showing a nigga love cause a nigga got skills 
A little sumthin sumthin, corny cats must flee 
Rah Digga forms the lines with the Ab' MC 

(Rah Digga) 
Ahhhhh.... 
Peace Tip, the love flows abundant 
To paste one, the underdopeless and youngin 
Rappers be off on a tangent 
I could flow longer than the van with 
Backwards stand smith 
When I go bring the noise 
I sweep rappers by the "Bunch" like they Brady's boys 
So change your sound 'fore I claim that crown 
That's for all yall home girls on dangerous groudns 

[Q-Tip](Rah Digga){chorus X4} 
Sometimes I just be wonderin 
How these cats be com-in IN 
.......... 
I think we need to rectify this right? 
(And show these muthafuckas how we Mardi Gras) 

[Yeah yeah Native Tongue's in the house](Mmm, hmm) 
[Yeah yeah Outsider's in the house](Outsiders in the hosue) 
[Yeah the UMMAH's in the hosue](UMMAH's in the house) 
[Big Tribe in the house] </pre>
