Yeah, you know what this is. NYC
The triumphant return (Rakim Allah)

Rakim:

Remember being introduced to rapping your first rhyme
It's pivotal like a fiends first high
Hustlers first ride players first dime
Unforgettable like a ladies first time
The world been waiting for euphoria
The true form with a sixth sense new nausea
True talk to the tomb so you forced me to go hard
Like the streets is the womb
And New York be the birth place of hip hop
Get it, it's the model where swagger was born
We set trends to follow
The home of the gods, the go-getters and my flow
Ain't a city been so prolific since Cairo
Hiero-glyphic, graffiti paint of view 
Slang ? too, just naming a few
Still claiming through that thing that you do
Til you famous and just love for the game and this bangers for you

Euphoria, Euphoria natural high
Feeling good off this hip hop I supply
Time goes by, still world wide
Still top five rapping, dead or alive
Euphoria (The world been waiting for euphoria)

Styles P:

I love hip hop to death, drop science like Rakim, my thoughts manifest
Yeah I'm the ghost but you can see me in the flesh
? a father that he can see me through the test
It wasn't for rap my life will probably be a mess
Used to sell crack outside had a bad attitude
Used to scrap outside but listen to that motherfucker rap outside
You can hear me over the guns that clap outside
True warrior raps my euphoria
Only my mind can bring me this many stories up
No elevators, no escalators spit hard 'til death or respirators
This is alpha omega nigga get your data
I transform when the mic plugged in
Cause the feelings euphoric cause I spit boric

Euphoria, Euphoria natural high
Feeling good off this hip hop I supply
Time goes by, still world wide
Still top five rapping, dead or alive
Euphoria (The world been waiting for euphoria)

Jadakiss:

At the end of the day what does it all amount to
Verses too strong to be sold over the counter
Industry is like a night club and I'm a bouncer
I don't give a fuck about what you can sell and ounce for
Nah, that ain't the topic of discussion
It's the music ya'll niggas think it's knocking it's disgusting
I rather just pull it out, cock it then bust it
Feels like he plugged into a socket when you touch it
Ain't a thang for me, pain then glory
Temporary thug exchange the same story
That's why I'm still militant, still killing it
Soon as it enters the blood stream start feeling it
Then it's all good long as you know what you dealing with
Knowledge of the game that I got I'm concealing it
I'm talking to all of ya'll put the four four to ya
Kiss is a warrior, this is euphoria

Euphoria, Euphoria natural high
Feeling good off this hip hop I supply
Time goes by, still world wide
Still top five rapping, dead or alive
Euphoria (The world been waiting for euphoria)

Busta Rhymes:

It's like I'm dealing with spirits and 'bout to send a ghost to get 'em
When they hear me spit I make them tremble like the dope was in 'em
Going into convulsions from the size of the weed bag
Victims is regular junkies this celebrity rehab
Respected by all of the godfathers and the new names
They got a love for my product insert it in their blue vein, okay
They on my neck when I come around like a new chain
Niggas know my rep and the dosage when I bring the new flame
Niggas all feeling the same effect, this shit is lethal
Like they was shooting the same shit, using the same needle
When I'm steady busting hollows I'm always ready to start this
You niggas is like ? the cartridge
You can see how the drug impacted the street from the responses
It saturate the planet was all apart of the process
The shit we get we take it to another place you can't ignore it
To a higher stimulation, nigga shit is so euphoric

Euphoria, Euphoria natural high
Feeling good off this hip hop I supply
Time goes by, still world wide
Still top five rapping, dead or alive
Euphoria (The world been waiting for euphoria)</pre>
