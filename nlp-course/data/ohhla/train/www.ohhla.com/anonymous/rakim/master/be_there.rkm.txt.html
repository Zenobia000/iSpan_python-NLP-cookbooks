Artist: Rakim
Album:  The Master
Song:   I'll Be There
Typed by: www.rakim.net

(Chorus) 
I will always be there 
I always be there for you 
I will always be there 
I'll be there 
  
(1st verse) 
I'm bout to meet my comrade on the busy Ave where we clash 
Trying to see how much gritty cash this city has 
Meantime harass every bitty that pass 
And then here you come with your pretty ass 
All petite like you make ends meet on Wall Street 
Your for keeps couldn't find a woman more complete 
You got your head on tight and when you talk I like 
For me and you two different walks of life 
I'm in the streets too much I pack the heat too much 
Put too much trees in the Dutch and don't keep in touch 
You try to get in contact I don't respond back 
Where the god at come back smellin' like cognac 
Baby beware I'm tryin' my best to be fair 
Aye yo-the key here is repair this love we share 
Cause if we care we would prepare to see clear 
Eye to eye we here as long as you be there 
  
(Chorus) 
I will always be there 
I will always be there for you 
I will always be there 
I'll be there 
  
(2nd verse) 
Yo, I'm startin' to understand it you like your evenings enchanted 
Love is bond, organic- restaurants romantic 
Want me to take your hand and take you around the planet 
But I take advantage and take you for granted 
Call collect explainin' why I ain't came yet 
I ain't winnin' the game yet can I get a rain check 
Blow me a kiss in the wind, I'm missin' again 
Don't let your sisters and your friends tell you this is the end 
Talk a hole in your head puttin' bugs in your ear 
Make you role in your bed when your thug ain't there 
Somewhere around ladies know I get lonely and proud 
Open my file baby you should know me by now 
Tryin' to get paid and stay away from old sites 
Find my place in life plus I like to hold mics 
It might be seven whole days and seven whole nights 
But yo it's gonna be alright just hold tight 
  
(Chorus) 
I will always be there 
I will always be there for you 
I will always be there 
I'll always be there baby 
  
(3rd verse) 
Who said something good won't last forever 
I know too much of any thing is bad ìwhateverî 
Long as we have good and bad times together 
Bad times make the good times that much better 
Peaches and cream, diamonds and ice 
You like pieces of dreams you shinin' in the night 
Features of a Queen and your mind frame is tight 
Timin' is right get ready for the time of your life 
You speak about stackin' gees and havin' seeds 
Apparently we know it's no guarantee 
But losin' you boo who smooth as you 
You unusual this is for the cool in you 
And for the chill I will forever come real 
Your appeal makes it hard to keep my love concealed 
All it took was one look, one kiss, one meal 
Now come feel, let's make this a done deal 
  
(Chorus)(4x) 
I will always be there 
I will always be there for you 
I will always be there 
I'll be there</pre>
