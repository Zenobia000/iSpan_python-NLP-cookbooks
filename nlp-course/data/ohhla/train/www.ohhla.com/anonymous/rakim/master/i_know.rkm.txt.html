Song:   I Know

(1st verse) 
Aye yo, who's the most explosive one yet? 
The a roundest one left 
Who flows express to them rhythm drum set ain't done yet? 
Flow like a trumpet to your eardrum are deaf 
Who pose a threat? 
Yo- who's more ferocious- none yet 
To the night damn set mic trends and life ends 
In sight, I see the whole world through a tight lens 
Rhymes I write wins and kept a white Benz 
Spend G's like hundreds and hundreds like tens 
I get paid, Black, but laid back with mild manners 
When I flip it's the opposite of dark Bruce Banner 
Out the lab with soul and melodies in your ear 
And just when it all seem clear I disappear 
All you gotta do is holler 
Reappear like vol-la the street scholar 
I'm 40 deep like Ali Baba 
Give the mamas something to talk about in the beauty parlor 
Keep it hot like lava, yeah 
It's Rakim Allah 
  
(Chorus) 
I know you find it hard to believe that 
I am the genie of the mic an 
I can do anything you wish but 
Right now I'm commanding you to dance 
  
(2nd verse) 
Ready to dance y'all, my magic carpet's the dance floor 
Last chance y'all even if you can't ball 
What part don't you understand? Your wish is my command 
And I'm a rock a jam by popular demand 
You gone love this, it's marvelous, baby 
It gotta thug's twist-it start to get crazy 
It's off the meat rack- can't keep my peeps back 
Speak raps and I freak tracks for these cats 
I got a fetish for puttin' together words and letters 
It ain't all about the cheddars and y'all know where my head is 
Ghetto scriptures for my little brothers and sisters 
And still get vicious for the thugs and the Misses 
What I don't do is talk about the same old thing 
When I come through, I drop it, and they gone swing 
I bring the ladies joy until they make crazy noise 
Cuz the beat's bangin'- I'm born to blaze, baby boy 
  
(Chorus) 
I know I you find it hard to believe that 
I am the genie of the mic an 
I can do anything you wish but 
Right now I'm commanding you to dance 
  
(3rd verse) 
The editor-forever more the predator, I said it all 
I spread a war, like never before 
Spit lead at yours like a ghetto braud raw at a ? 
She'll never pause 
With raw metaphors, I set it off 
But I just begun the best is yet to come 
Blessed with a majestic tongue since I was young 
But I was stressed for funds and obsessed with guns 
Test the one, let Allah protect your son 
Cause something musical magician, the ageiathic author 
The microphone magician when I have a magic marker, a mentor 
You can explore, every sentence is a tour 
The inventor is more than adventure 
You'll be blown away, and a zone ? 
It's so ill, I still grab the microphone and say 
One of my own displays like I'm known to blaze 
And I bet rhyme pays until I'm old and gray 
  
(Chorus)(4x) 
I know you find it hard to believe that 
I am the genie of the mic and 
I can do anything wish but 
Right now I'm commanding you to dance</pre>
