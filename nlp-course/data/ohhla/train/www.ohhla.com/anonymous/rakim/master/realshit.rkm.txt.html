Artist: Rakim f/ Canibus
Album:  The Master
Song:   Real Shit
Typed by: www.rakim.net, WizdomNXS@aol.com

Yeah 
It's the paragraph ambassador 
The wild style fashioner 
It's the god Rakim, the master 
Feel this 
  
(1st verse) 
This is that lost ass track off-the-rack kind of a track 
You forced to rap, remember that? It's that 
You know where I'm at, there go the gat 
Pass me a bat, the kill-or-be-killed kind of attack 
Steamin' ___, speedin' navigatin' the map 
Negotiating with a chick, she got her head on your lap, ya hand on your gat 
Premeditated plan of attack, with two of your most deadliest mens in the back 
Comb the block, stop in the zone that's hot 
Get out like you own the spot, home or not 
It's that no mood to play, move out the my way 
Yo, I been whistlin' this tune from throughout the day 
Hey, yo, this is that ol' y'all niggas don't wanna battle 
Turn it up loud make the whole block rattle 
Boom boom- this one is gettin' blazin' hot 
Boom boom- make you bust another shot from the Glock 
  
(Chorus) 
From the streets below to everything above 
To the heart that pumps Ra-kim Allah's blood 
I swear I kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug 
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues 
From the streets beneath my feet to the sun 
I'm number one and competition is still none 
And I'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs 
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues 
  
(2nd verse) 
Here we come now 
Turntable spin like a merry-go-round 
Never slow down, depending on how good your stereo sounds 
Set it, up in the hood where we go surround 
Tearin' through towns, turn 'em into burial grounds 
This is the track that made Theodore wanna scratch 
The track that caused the first kid to spin on his back 
And then we saw, kids spray-painting the wall 
While some of y'all was waitin' for war breakin' the law 
It's no antidote it's what you can't provoke 
So just relax with your girls or your mans and smoke 
And take a real hit, soon as it bang you feel quick 
It's real thick, this is that ol' real shit 
This is the description of designs for you to listen to 
Reminiscin' the times and nothin' in particular 
Keep you goin' just like a whole pot of coffee 
Have you and your shorty doin' 80 in a 40 
  
(Chorus) 
From the streets below to everything above 
To the heart that pumps Ra-kim Allah's blood 
I swear I kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug 
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues 
From the streets beneath my feet to the sun 
I'm number one and competition is still none 
And I'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs 
  
(3rd verse) 
You know what this is 
Yeah kid, give up your riches 
Vicious, visions is not for motion pictures 
Unstoppable, rollin' witcha sickest clique of niggas 
Or witcha missus, gettin tropical kisses 
Makin' faces, anticipatin' places her tongue hits 
Suck her neck or just peck, better to funk it 
The EP is in effect from dusk to sunset 
She want a rim shot all over her drum set 
Jump the bed rubbin' your head- it's rough sex 
50 ways to keep a love wet 
Down and up the steps with crazy positions left till she upset 
"Damn, baby, you ain't come yet?" 
Hell, no- doomstick big as a elbow 
Gel soft, well blow, give him a minute, he'll grow 
And all you gotta do is play the track again 
I'm ready and revived, baby, back again 
  
(Chorus) 
From the streets below to everything above 
To the heart that pumps Ra-kim Allah's blood 
I swear I kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug 
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues 
From the streets beneath my feet to the sun 
I'm number one and competition is still none 
And I'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs 
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues 

[Canibus]
Yo! 
Check it, Yo! 
  
I'm faster than leopards running across the vast desert 
in twenty-two yards per second to catch me to daily delicatessen 
It takes me thirty minutes to eat'em, forty minutes to digest'em, 
and fifty minutes for it to pass through my intestines 
So ask yourself a question?(What question?) 
Can the Canibus rhyme? 
Is a fuckin porcupine half swine? 
No time to make up your mind, you wanna run or die?
Clip you while you're running by, trip you up from behind 
My rhymes, confuse niggas 
Like somebody try to gang-bang 
Wearin' a blue shirt and red pants, throwin' up signs with there left hand 
Standin' out on the corner of wetlands with a confederate flag for a headband 
God dam eggplants, niggas getting' me vexed man 
Cause I'm surrounded by garbage like Fred Sav 
And I can't seem to get away from it 
I dreamed that I stabbed leviathan through the stomach, and ate from it 
In my past life I slayed hundreds, and in the life before that 
I played trumpets, to warn you that I was comin' 
There's one billion ways to die, and I already tried 
nine-hundred million nine hundred and ninety nine 
When I aim and fire my rhymes, like a hundred cannon balls flying 
Striking you one at a time, in a parallel line 
While the art of emceeing is steady dieing 
Canibus and Rakim Allah is still in there prime! 
  
(Chorus) 
From the streets below to everything above 
To the heart that pumps Ra-kim Allah's blood 
I swear I kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug 
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues 
From the streets beneath my feet to the sun 
I'm number one and competition is still none 
And I'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs 
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues</pre>
