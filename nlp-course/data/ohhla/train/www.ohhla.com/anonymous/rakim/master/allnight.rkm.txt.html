All Night Long 

(1st verse) 
I'm back! The god remains, still at the end 
They sabotage the game, still I'm a win 
Rakim Allah's the name, and with a pen 
No one can dodge the rain, kill'em again 
In a club or the streets I swerve, cool in the cut 
Looking to see what occurs, crusin' the truck 
Shorty got deadly curves, soothin' her up 
If I must explain with words, I smooth as a fuck! 
The world's most greatest hip-hop's elite 
You obsolete, you cannot compete, drop the beat 
Keep ya ear to the ground when I rock the street 
Cock the heat, we deep papi got to eat 
So cut on the mic and spit, I much rougher 
Plenty of ice and a whip, plus a crusher 
Because I don't like to stick, or bust a brother 
Long as they never forget I'm a ill muther fucker 
  
(Chorus) 
So if you love to get your party on 
And you feel that your game is strong 
And you get mad when the broads is gone 
You like it all-night-long 
And when they love it when the place is warm 
And they go out for their favorite song 
They hate when the player game is wrong 
They like it all-night-long 
  
(2nd verse) 
My caliber's out rated 
Yeah player, so why hate it 
My rhyme through out of control, when I say it 
Spit back with a rap or gat, can I spray it 
How can I say it? I leave it de-hydrated 
I take aim, and he keep the place flamin' 
Till the place cave in, aye yo this ain't a safe haven 
  
The best is yet to come, so they stay in 
They keep the music loud, the lights is low 
The kid with a different style, I like to flow 
It's time to move the crowd, tonight's the show 
See what it's all about, they like to go 
Get henny and mo and cris, the clothes, the platinum, gold, the wrist 
Plenty of doe, and chicks who pose for flicks 
Women who love roll their hips, when I'm holding this 
  
(Instrumental chorus) 
  
My mic's a equipped with a microchip, with a million Megs 
Bite this I might flip, spread a billion plagues 
Put medicine in it before I kill ya dead 
You can get away, if you can fill your legs 
Could you walk? No, at least you thought though 
Auto fours blow a hole in your torso 
Damage his brain with more flow until he talk slow 
Try to say something now? I thought so! 
I leave emcee's bleeding, while I'm fleeing across sea-in 
Start breeding, double my Swiss cheese in Sweden 
Free on the weekend, come back see if he breathing 
They breathing, somebody left his brains beat in 
A deadly attack is rare, style will be raw 
Be ready to rap you'll hear, as wild as before 
If I bust a gat in the air, watch the galaxy fall 
And the world will be splat on the floor, that'll be all</pre>
