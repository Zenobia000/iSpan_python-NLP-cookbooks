Typed by: Cedmaster3K

{"I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out..."}
{"I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out"}

[French] Yeah

[Kanye West]
No matter how many times I've tried to you
I can't lie to you, I can't lie to you

{"I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out"}

[Kanye West] + (French) + {Nas}
I never lied to you (uhh) I can't
{I can't lie y'all} (Uhh) {he disrespected y'all} (whoa)
No matter how times I've tried to you
I can't lie to you, I can't lie to you, I can't

{"Always on my mind... I can't figure it out..."}

[Kanye West] + (French Montana)
Uhh, just like a nigga, go figure (hah)
(Some shit they said they might never figure - hah)
More figures, more hatin' ass niggas
More commas, more hatin' ass problems (hah)

[Chorus: Kanye West] + (French Montana)
{"I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out"}
No matter how much I've tried
(No matter how much I've tried - hah)
Can't lie to you, I can't lie to you
{"I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out"}
Uhh, no matter how many times I (hah)
No matter how many rhymes I (hah)
I got it all in my mind, ah (hah)
I got it all in my mind, ah-uh
{"Always on my mind"} Uh, I can't lie to you
No matter how many times I've tried
{"I can't figure it out"} I can't, I can't lie to you, I
I can't, I can't lie to you, I

[French Montana]
Uhh; comin' from the back block, posted like the backdrop
Rags to the riches, got rich and bought the ragtop
Lot of homies died here, look at what the grind did
Put me in the same shoes, still do what Shyne did
{"I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out"}
More digits, more bitches, more riches
They don't want no broke niggas but don't call them gold diggers
I don't know, I don't know why I ain't get the picture
Why Cosby slipped her? Why I fucked 'em both when they said they sisters?
Why Eazy ain't have the Magic?
Why A.I. never won a 'ship?
And why God took Max and Chinx and he ain't take me when I got hit?

[Chorus]

[Nas] + (Kanye West)
Can't y'all, I can't

Beyond Pérignon, the fame, the money
The Baccarat Crystal that’s hangin' from the ceilings above me
Hearin' people whisper, screamin' I'm lucky but trust me
Nothin' come free, shawty tried to keep my son from me
Or I, could be delirious to take life serious
Remain single forever, can't wife nothin', period
I'm a G, I need privacy, media's never kind to me
Niggas beefin' on small time things, we on a dyin' spree (uhh)
He disrespected y'all (just like a nigga, go figure)
He talkin' reckless, yo
I can’t accept it, yo (no matter how much I've tried)
For the love of my people, I guess I'll let it go
I can't figure it out, uh, uh

[Chorus] w/ minor variations
