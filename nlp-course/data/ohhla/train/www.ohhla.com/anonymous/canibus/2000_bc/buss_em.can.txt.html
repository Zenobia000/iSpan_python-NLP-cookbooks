Artist: Canibus f/ Rakim 
Album:  2000 B.C.  
Song:   I'll Buss 'Em You Punish 'Em    
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash, wu-gambino@deathrowrecords2000.com

[Canibus]
Yeah, I'll buss 'em, and you punish 'em
Uhh, yeah..

[C] Let me buss 'em
[R] Naw, I'ma punish 'em
[C] Ra, let me buss 'em
[R] Naw, I'ma punish 'em
[C] Naw, let me buss 'em
[R] Naw, I'ma punish 'em
[C] Come on Ra, let me buss 'em
[R] Yo 'Bis, you can punish 'em

[Canibus]
Yo, yo..
Now on some battlin shit, my verbal lateral grip
leeps my tongue glued to the A-Dat when I'm trackin' my shit
Let my spit lubricate the chap on my lips
And make you rappers have fits 'cause I'm back in the mix
Fuck a pad and a pen, write rhymes on a IBM
Ebonics is dead, the binary language is in
Canibus practices in a room wit a thousand candles lit
Meditatin on this rap shit
Because my freestyle reigns sovereign
wit a deeper conscience than the prophet Muhammad was born wit
My brain cavity is enormous
My left hemisphere alone harnesses all of the seven chakras
While the right one harnesses darkness
The type of dark that makes a house haunted
The type of dark that niggaz get lost in
The type of dark you fear when you dead in the coffin
I hear you talkin, but I ignore it
Cause it's garbage and your rhyme's borin 
So keep standin on the corner
the trash man'll collect you in the mornin
Thug cats frontin, wacker than Blinky Blink 
on the back of the Raptor wagon babblin about nothin 
Fuck that, real Rugrats can get it on black
Meet me at The Tunnel where pussy niggaz get mugged at
So dark you never see the blood splat
and you can't even react, cause the trunk is where you keep the guns at
Now you on speed, cause you too scared to come back
You can't even breathe, the weed suffocates your lung sacs
Fake MC's haul ass like they runnin track 
whereever Canibus or Rakim is at

{*Chorus*}
[C] Let me buss 'em
[R] Naw, I'ma punish 'em
[C] Naw, let me buss 'em
[R] Naw, I'ma punish 'em
[C] Ra, let me buss 'em
[R] Naw, I'ma punish 'em
[C] Naw, let me buss 'em
[R] Naw, I'ma punish 'em
[C] Naw, et me buss 'em
[R] Naw, I'ma punish 'em
[C] Ra, let me buss 'em
[R] Naw, I'ma punish 'em
[C] Naw, let me buss 'em
[R] Naw, I'ma punish 'em
[C] Come on Ra, let me buss 'em
[R] Yo 'Bis, let me punish 'em

[Rakim]
Be ready and at your best, the +Celebrity+ +Match+ of +Death+
Heart snatched through your chest, cardiac arrest
Crack your neck while I break your arms, catch your breath
Then I asked the ref, "How many cats is left?"
One on one, who challengin?  Come get did
All I have is a pen and punish you kids
Abdomen punctured and look what I done to his wig
Wanna live then I stab 'em in the lung with his rib
Every word I say detach a vertebrae from your spine
Rematch wherever we meet at, any place anytime
Get your snot-box smashed with a nine, smacked with a rhyme
Push your forehead to the back of your mind
Try to explain, what it's like seein your brain
Your insane, whose gonna ID the remains?
And then I reincarnate 'em, and kill 'em again
Again and again, again and again, c'mon

{*Chorus*}

[Canibus]
Yo, yo, yo we started the battle with a grapple
The nigga had long hair so I grabbed a handful
and chopped him in the Adam's apple
His partner in back of you tried to attack you
So I'ma twist 'em up like a pret-zel then I'ma tag you

[Rakim]
I'm on some stone cold shit, warn your whole click
Cartilage gettin torn until the whole bone split
Who wanna spit, bang 'em quick, strangle 'em wit his lip
Try to flip, leave his body danglin by his hip

[Canibus]
Ra, you left him danglin
I can't believe he tryin to grapple again
I swing him around like I'm dancin wit him
Put his arms in back of his head and snapped him again
Fractured his limbs and put him in the figure 6 subtracted from 10

[Rakim]
Seven birds make 'em swerve 'til they vision is blurred
Turn cats that souped from superb to nerds
Just say the word, I'll leave your DNA on the curb
and stick my dick in your ear - and fuck what you heard

[C] Let me finish 'em
[R] Nah, its time to pin 'em
[C] Ra, lemme finish 'em 
[R] Nah, I'ma pin 'em
[C] Nah, Lemme finish 'em
[R] Nah, it's time to pin 'em
[C] C'mon, Ra, lemme finish 'em
[R] Nah 'Bis, I'ma put it in 'em</pre>
