[Swizz]
Remix
 
[Chorus][Nas]
Now, niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, They should salute me
So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfucking general
Now, niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, They should salute me
So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfucking general
 
[Nas]
Yo Esco illing, Swizz Beatz illing
What more can we say, stop grilling
'Fore you get hit up, shut up good
We'll merc you in your hood
I'm el pacino, Nas the God, you'll lose your life
Whether on the corner or clubs, I'm shooting dice
Break my cipha, I'm get at you
Slice you, knife you, stab you, shank you, splay ya'll
Too many rappers is jealous, who be gasing the fellows
Bunch of actors who never sold a crack in the ghetto
Went from nasty to Esco, back to nasty
Clapping that black heat
None of ya'll are matching my level, I'm the general
 
[Chorus][Nas]
Now, niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, They should salute me
So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfucking general
Now, niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, They should salute me
So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfucking general
 
[Fat Joe]
Nowadays I'm on some mack shit
But I used to be loyal to tax, cracks
The nigga that would soil-in your jacks
Feed 'em with trays the size of light bulbs
Coke so bright, it shine like white gold
And the hoes love Joe way before this rap shit
Before the Versace floors and the rolls to match it
Joe's a bastard, I sell pussy for cheap
Make my bitch walk the strip with no shoes on her feet
Don't front for me, you kids is not balling
If you is then why is your wiz on my dick like I'm Jordan
Ties swollen for no man with bold plans
Sick of this rap shit thats why I listen to slow jams
I'm a grown man, the talk of the strip
Niggas think I'm Kev Childs that way I boss this shit
Dogs you's a bitch, I'm here to bring you a muzzle
Saying I'm peeping, I'ma bring you a muzzle
Get the point, General
 
[Chorus][Nas]
Now, niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, They should salute me
So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfucking general
Now, niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, They should salute me
So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfucking general
 
[Cassidy]
It's Cassidy, I get rock like a boat when you go fishing
Ayo, Listen I'm the general like Tso's chicken
I'm so sick you can tell by the expression on my face
That I'll get in that ass like preparation H
The weapon the waist and I spray guns off
Cuz if its beef, I'ma be on top of it like A-1 sauce
Pause, now who's the truth (me), Who's quick to shoot (me)
My four-fifth got kick like Bruce Lee
See, I'm a true G, hotter than soup be
Raw like sushi, you gotta salute me
You dudes see, I'll put in an order for you
I'll let the water boil, cook in a quarter in the oil
I had it for sell, but ya'll faggots would tell
Go to jail and start singing like Patti LaBelle
I ain't gonna back in a cell, you rat and you did
Fuck a vest, put a bullet-proof hat on your head
When I'm clapping the lead, I'll murder a nigga
And if he say "he ain't the feds", then I'm serving the nigga
I'm thristy for the change, playing games ain't a issue now
A bitch would give you AIDS nowadays if she kiss you now
I got that coke and that haze on my grillizy now
We going to war, you gonna need more than a pistol now
They throwing missles round, you still trying to get a nine
Uh, its the last days, end of time
The terrorists jacking planes, sending bombs to the Pentegon
They off the hook like intercoms, we just had a bad wintertime
So you know they gonna start to rob
And steal for a mil when its dinnertime
YOu still spending time focusing on dumb shit
On the block smoking, but you broken on some bumshit
What the hell, you might as well put a suit and tie on
Jump into a casket and get your die on</pre>
