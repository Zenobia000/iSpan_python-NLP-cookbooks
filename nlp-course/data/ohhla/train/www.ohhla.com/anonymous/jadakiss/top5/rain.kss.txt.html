Artist: Jadakiss f/ Nas, Styles P
Album:  Top 5 Dead or Alive
Song:   Rain
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Jadakiss]
Thunderstorm and the forecast
More time to meditate on ya war path
To the face wit a whole blunt
All my chains and a watch on that's a cold front
Yea they wishing I come around more
But when I do they don't notice the heavy downpour
Haters prayin' on my death on my downfall
They got me lookin' for my shadow like the ground hog
Its get frightening all you see is the lightning
Niggas ungrateful bitches is just trifling
Can't be real wit ya self its not right then
Different from everybody else but not like them
Need the respect gotta have the power
If I squeeze this teck that's a scattered shower
Guaranteed that its gonna touch you
Hoes wanna fuk niggas wanna hustle
No offense but you better D up
Whenever it rains is the best time to re-up
Niggas you wanna kill family members is ill
The shit you think about about as each drop hit the seal
Crib paid for the kids get a couple mill
Smoke a lil' weed you might pop a couple pills
Sharp as a ginsu everybody against you
Things that you get yourself into is all mental
It's a lot of pain in my tears
Dark thoughts turn into criminal ideas
Just like where do you see yourself in five years
I've always been a superior to my peers
Yea and my rain ain't stop yet
Even though its mostly the lames that got wet
I'm all about a profit I pull it out and pop it
And no umbrella or raincoat can't stop it

[Chorus]
Styles P: they say life's a bitch nigga
Kiss: real niggas love bitches tho
Styles P: misery loves company
Kiss: Yeah, fuck it nigga I'm miserable
Styles P: They say when it rains it pours
Kiss: Rain
Styles P: They say when it rains it pours
Kiss: Rain Rain Rain

[Nas]
I'm the weather report
I'm the president of this veteran sport
Make it feel chill like you need ya pelly back on
I'm cosmic I'm full storm from the projects
Yea its in the air you ain't gotta tellI'm who Nas is
Skies is red winds is 7 miles per hour
Light showers visibility clearly
No one real as me cowards
Never speak to cops only speak to attorneys
Had to leave the block took the whole hood on my journey
Hear these niggas talkin, who they talkin' to
I ascended from heaven I can walk on the moon
Everybody a killa guess everybody a goon
Not every don is a don till a don walk in the room
Right state of emergency autumn leaves mother nature
Feel the urgency the reign I rain hot springs
Nueva York they throw salt
Kama Sutra in female thoughts I'm stalked
So I pray like it Jumah it rains

[Jadakiss]
Yo when you on top of the world the game is yours
And ya dope is uncut ya cane is pure
The problems start coming it rains it pours
And ya money is not long enough to change the law
You figured everyhting would be done in one night
All you wanted is shine but the sun is on strike then
Cash comes in then the love stop
Ice in the bezel that's a flood watch
Heavy precipitation
There's nothing you can do that can better the situation
They ain't say it ain't safe to drive in
Its on you how you got about surviving
In the rain nigga

[Chorus]
Styles P - they say life's a bitch nigga
Kiss - real niggas love bitches tho
Styles P - misery loves company
Kiss - yea fuck it nigga I'm miserable
Styles P - they say when it rains it pours
Kiss - Rain
Styles P - they say when it rains it pours
Kiss - Rain Rain Rain</pre>
