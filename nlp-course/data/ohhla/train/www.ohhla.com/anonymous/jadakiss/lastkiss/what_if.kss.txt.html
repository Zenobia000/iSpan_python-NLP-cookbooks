Album:  The Last Kiss
Song:   What If
Typed by: DaSun Akbar

[Jadakiss]
Yo, take a second
What if we could rewind the hood?
Better yet, what if the Lox woulda signed wit Suge?
What if Puffy neva signed us?
What if Oprah made them comments like Imus?
What if you designed us?
Thought like I did, said it like this
What if Payton was fightin' dogs instead of Mike Vick?
What if Arnold woulda just let Tookie get Life?
What if BIG missed the party?
What if Pac missed the fight?
What if you was caged in?
What would you change then?
What if there was no Rockefeller law for made men?
What if hate ran thru me?
And what if Portland woulda drafted Jordan instead of Sam Bowie?
What if you really had to be nice to get a deal?
What if all of these rappers ice was really real?
What if I hit you wit the razor from cheek to chin?
What if Mike Jackson neva woulda bleached his skin?

(Hook) Jadakiss 2x
What if you neva knew things that you needed to know?
What if you neva been places you needed to go?
What if you get there and learn them as you go?
What if is the question, can I ask them once more?

[Jadakiss]
What if the pain went away?
What if you changed in a day?
What if you could eliminate all the games people played?
What if Shyne beat the case?
What if Diddy did a dime flat?
What if Nelson Mandela could give his time back?
What if Malcolm was silent?
What if Martin was violent?
What if you could really sneak an Uzi on the Island?
Yeah, what if I make you kiss the nina?
What if a brick was only just a misdemeanor?
What if Manhattan was hit by Hurricane Katrina?
What if a Black man was the one controllin' FEMA?
What if we ain't neva let emotions come between us?
What if the last time we rode somebody seen us?

(Hook) Jadakiss 2x

[Nas]
Yo, I flow calm but don't push
What if Saddam hung Bush?
What if 'One Mic' was called one hook?
What if the Bridge neva showed me how to hold a weapon?
What if I ran up in that sick shit wit no protection?
What if I neva wore an Army jacket?
Carhartt to match it, unlaced Timbs
The hood on my first album cover under plastic
What if I was another corny rapper?
What if I went instead of Notorious?
Who would tell my story after?
What if I love less and lust more?
If Obama was on Rushmore
Would Ali give Tyson a bust jaw?
What if I neva glared out that project window?
Would neva be scared for the life of me and my kinfolk
What if that gun pin broke?
I would neva linked back in the Enzo, all red
What if real niggas was all dead?
What if Hilary and them was Reptilian?
And 2012 was the end of men and all world civilians?
