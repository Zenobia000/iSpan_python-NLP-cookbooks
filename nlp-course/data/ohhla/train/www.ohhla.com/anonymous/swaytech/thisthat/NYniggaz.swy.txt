[Guru]
New York niggaz, universal, unique
And ain't nuttin sweet in these streets, we gotta eat
New York niggaz, every borough is thorough
Makin moves today, and then tomorrow

I slay my prey, with exellence, eloquence, and reverance
You can't compete, so I suggest you lamp
or meet defeat at the feet of my elite fleet
I mistreat these beats like hoes and put em in the street
Like seven hoodlums in a Jeep I creep up on ya
Brook-? to California, I embalm phony performers
Cause the actors like Leonardo, DiCaprio
Don't make me wanna put down this mic, walk up, slap you yo
and tap you yo, and take you out of your misery
Don't ever front the role for these bitches, thinkin you dissin me

New York niggaz, universal, unique
And ain't nuttin sweet in these streets, we gotta eat
New York niggaz, every borough is thorough
Makin moves today, and once again son, tomorrow
New York niggaz, universal, unique
And ain't nuttin sweet in these streets, we gotta eat
New York niggaz, goin out for the loot
And most won't hesitate to cock and shoot

Yo, yo, I cut deeper, you're much weaker, I crush speakers
See nuff heaters here in New Yitty
That's where it's grimy and gritty, word to Frank Nitty
Got strippers showin their titties, bourgeoise hoes actin saditty
And every spot got it's own ghetto
Liquor stores on all the corners, plus drugs guns with ammo
No example set, for thugs in the projects
Only examples they get, is how to unload the tec
Out for respect, props and dough to collect
The root of it all yo, is you need loot to ball yo
If my back's against the wall yo, I'ma bang you til you fall you
Slang slash a buck fifty niggaz is shifty
Gonna have to send more of your goons out to get me
How could you compare this here, with that weak shit there
Word to my man Sincere, we'll make you travel in fear
Like apparations I appear and disappear
New York in the house, so suckers play the fuckin rear

New York niggaz, universal, unique
And ain't nuttin sweet in these streets, we gotta eat
New York niggaz, every borough is thorough
Makin moves today, and once again son, tomorrow

Pay attention, or get placed on suspension
Situation's you gonna face, beyond your comprehension
You'll be like, "Why is all these niggaz after me?"
Way up shit's creek, that's where your ass will be
Actually, you brought the shit all on yourself
Now niggaz is schemin, all on your wealth
Future health is in danger, simply cause of anger
Got niggaz lookin to hang ya, or straight rearrange ya
You better hold your head, you better hide your bread
Cause these niggaz ain't playin, they're leavin all victims dead
They labelled you as their next target
See, you was frontin, actin like you was the hardest
Regardless, you know them niggaz is hungry yo
And ain't shit funny yo, they want respect and money yo

New York niggaz, universal, unique
And ain't nuttin sweet in these streets, we gotta eat
New York niggaz, every borough is thorough
Makin moves today, and then tomorrow, tomorrow

That's right, Brook-? to California
New York City in the house
Peace to Sway and Tech
and all my cats in the system
You catch much respect
Hold your head
New York baby
