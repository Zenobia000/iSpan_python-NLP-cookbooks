SHUG
Yeah its time for me to step up and get me a piece of this mutherfuckin pie 
Yah nam sayin, I know you cats been waitin for the real
Thats all I know, on this track somethings about to get broke up
You got to respect that 
Its only right
Word up

I rock for niggas that box, pull triggers on glocks
Hang out all day on hot blocks
When you yell "lets go" they dont stop
Their soul mission is to be on top
This is a score for soldiers of war 
And veteran rap crews that go on world tour
I stay lyrically fit to beat the shit
Out of compit-ish that wish to flip
Im comin through like 2 blows
Crack your clavical 
Hot like calicoes, outta control
I throw vicious hooks and upper cuts
To knock you on ya butt im in your face screaming "what"
And you supposed to be hard 
You get chased by attack dogs, up trees through backyards
Guru hit me on the hip, theres gonna be some shit
So grab your team and battleship
Im bombin shit like NATO, you wanna play yo'
I crush that ass like tomatoes
Forever it be me and gu
It aint a mutherfuckin thing you cats can do
And what, what what what
Counter punch and what
And what what what
Counter punch and what
 
"the shit gets drastic
they learn when I hit them"
Niggas be near the stage ice grillin and posted up
They dont know niggas with us be holstered up
Ready to toast it up, they try to approach but they cant quite get..close enough
Or they boun niggas snuff 
Counter punch counter punch beleedat
Niggas be near the stage ice grillin and posted up
They dont know niggas with us be holstered up
Ready to toast it up, they try to approach but they cant quite get..close enough
Or they boun niggas snuff
Counter punch counter punch beleedat yeah
"the shit gets drastic
they learn when I hit them"
 
GURU
Its too late in the game for us to choke 
And you dont want to provoke these og's to go for broke
We got outta state cat peelers, ex crack dealers
Ex cons, dons and macs that stack skrilla
And now we splittin the pie
Bussin of a lick in the sky
Soon as im spittin you die
Instantly, you just a wimp to me
My man premier orchestrates the breaks on this symphony
And now you know you should respect your fathers
Im understanding god as we continue this saga
Me and my nigga shug, go hood to hood
Understood, you tryin a buy props thats why you ridin the wood
Its all good, from lou-hill ave to humbo
Right here to NYC blazin trails like gun smoke 
Some toke, others be ready to fight ya
See more beef than butchers beat you down or just snipe ya
Counter punch
 
Niggas be near the stage ice grillin and posted up
They dont know niggas with us be holstered up
Ready to toast it up, they try to approch but they cant quite get..close enough
Or they boun niggas snuff
Counter punch counter punch beleedat yeah
"the shit gets drastic
they learn when I hit them"
 
SHUG
I get 2 cats in a verbal crossfire
And cock my hand back and slap the hellfire outta liars
Chill out in cockpits, puff fly with pilots
Aquire frequent flyer mileage
All black on, shoes sway violet
No matter how you flip it dun, I stay stylish
The girl im wit you dream to get between her
While I be on tour walkin the beaches of epa nema
See my nina, you runnin high
So id rather get the drop then punch you dead in the eye
You scarred of me, you outta be, cause basically
You just another wack ass mc
Im deadly, sickenin like the flu
You got 2 hours get out the game or ya through
So, come front and I will bust your circumference 
Big shug aint ever havin, none of that nonsence
Pass the word to ya team we out to lunch
And they cant withstand the mighty blow of the counter punch
And what, what what what
Counter punch and what
And what, what what what
Counter punch counter punch
 
"the shit gets drastic
they learn when I hit them"</pre>
