Artist: Slick Rick
Album:  Wild Wild West soundtrack
Song:   I Sparkle
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yeah, this one goes out to all them Moet clickers, knahmsayin?
From the old school, no, not the Crisal group
It's the Moet click, yaknahmsayin?
Sometimes the lesson I'm still holdin, yaknowhatImean?
Here it go.. are you..?

Dimes trash about, beg Rick ask them out
Moet click -- back in the house kid, ask about
In a vehicle not proud of, hi shouter and
marvel at the cars that the one I got outta
Dismantle all vandal who cannot hold a candle near
I outglitter the chandelier
Bougie [niggaz] talk and glance at enhance
who makes every [nigga] walkin dance
Plus the clothes you saw me gorgeous bout
would make a homosexual ask where I bought that outfit
No question, I answered all gangsters and
paralyzed moves like professional dancers and
So go West, we a family skunk of rap hits
to snap out of you that divide and conquer crap
Pass the bubbly - to the good guy starter
Rap style keep you in a good high bark, I sparkle

And move the middle
And move the middle
And move the middle
And move the middle

Glitter enter, even the stars in the million
and even the sun be like, "That kid over there brilliant"
Knew this isn't new deficit, all figure ripped
When I'm in the club, mad noise, at who the nigga is
Entertainment, alter, baldhead slaughter
and Moet sparks curse, hi my name Rick Walter and
about to offer lead to drop another muffin
Even dead folks nowadays hoppin out a coffin
What's one to do, goin to do, blunted too
son to who conduct the whole world if wanted to
Who assault viking, when he touch like lightning and
everybody know me, walk in sparkling
The co-sponsor, although I sworn all out
and don't doubt it if you see me in some cornball outfit
Pass the champagne to good guy start
Rap style keep you in a good high bark, I sparkle

And move the middle
And move the middle
And move the middle
And move the middle

Brother arouser, a chaffeur of ? propped
against stars bright, so stay over my housetop
Even little kids give up their milk and cookie to
The bartender open off Rick and start lookin to
A trailer full of women lovin the rhythm, I'm givin
and skin -- for what Rick -- for artiller within em
So let me explain it, famous, same
You know that the legendary reign this game kid
Massage and awaken who start to it
Old folk drop teeth breakin so hard to it
That's Rick, so any drunk like a glad kid
Do that little dance where you spin round a tad bit
All battlin done, just one hunch and I'll
fight punch you all, all you fans dysfunctional
So pass the bubbly - to the good guy starter
Rap style keep you in a good high bark, I sparkle

And move the middle
And move the middle
And move the middle
And move the middle

And move the middle
And move the middle
..
And move the middle

And move the middle
And move the middle</pre>
