Artist: Slick Rick
Album:  The Ruler's Back
Song:   I Shouldn't Have Done It
Typed by: goldenarms_10304@yahoo.com, WvW

[Slick Rick]
Well, I'ma tell you a story and I come out bluntly
Born an ugly child; hey, nobody would want me
I used to walk around and get upset and upsetter
Till I figured out ways to make myself look better
As I got older, my awareness expanded
I met this beautiful girl and my wish was commanded
Didn't hang wit fellas cause they started gettin shady
I'd always be wit my girl and ya could her my lady
I loved her a lot, word up, not going to front, see?
The problem that arose is why on earth did she want me?
Couldn't figure it out, and to make things worst
I was cursed, wit the torment of not being the first
And the first was this fly guy, made me very jealous
Ooh, I think he cheat on me, and talked to other fellas
Two wrongs don't make a right, but any time that we fight
I would call and took a phone and call a girl outta spite
I shouldn't have done it

[Chorus 2X: scratched up]
I'm feelin sad and blue

[Slick Rick]
I will to make this right, so director was admirin
I tried to stop my love, but no love was not retirin
To catcher in the rye was near impossible and tricky
Didn't want her in certain clothes, gettin really dickey
We got into it again, this time she got to bright
So me preventin a fight, I just stayed out for the night
I had to ease up of the record, all this hot increase
I went up to the parrot, wit a mega vance in vain
This girl came over, she was trucked down extensive
Startin talkin to me, and she was probably quite aggresive
A pretty young thing, she didn't strike me as no ho
So meet my nigga, rude and went on wit the flow
But Joe was gettin hard, without me even knowin
We stepped up back to my van and I could it's for growin
The girl took off her coat her body was no joke
Well, I rubbed it to unzip it, and I went for broke
I shouldn't have done it

[Chorus 4X: scratched up]

[Slick Rick]
Now I'm seein, that there's no one to blame
That night when I went home, I felt real guilty and ashamed
Snucked right into bed, I felt just like a shady fella
What made me so unsensitive, how I'm ever gonna tell her?
Shouldn't have cheated, just because we'd always doubt
Endurance, be a man, that's what I had to learn about
How me, I guess I like the wanted secrets that I did
I figure, I'd patch things up and then I'll tell what I did
Then after that, she started actin heaven sent
I found a house spot, let's say she help out wit the rent
So, I bought the ring, it was a good 20 Karat
Then word got back about me chillin at the parrot
So when I got home, I thought she'd just be out to roast
Instead I found this letter, and I found her overdosed
It said "I had it for you" but I guess she didn't care
All this wouldn't happen come of me and this fear
I shouldn't have done it

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
