[Slick Rick]
As you see Ruler show's, is enquirin noses
Goin into a story about a kid named Moses
Once a prophet was to be born, so for anything else furve it
Fear of orders, every first born, some murdered
One got away, a girl wit profit for a river
Gently put him in a basket, went floatin down a river
Then hands up by a fair up relative, or honey peep it
Couldn't be the severed, once determined to keep
Don't say a word, she told this slim, who was a real witch
Snitch, it'll definetly be the last day you breathin
Wild kids slaughter, cuz they was fronted them
Soldiers tellin the kid that they murdered every one of them
Thanks said Pharoah, guys little friend tips
Sister showin her baby sayin her River God sent it
To a brother who arose and said, "whoa sis"
Cure as I suppose this, the upward knows about Moses

[whistling and samples]

[Slick Rick]
As time passes, prove he wasn't the type to beg or borrow
Group to conquer land like ain't no tomorrow
Made the Sun King jealous cuz he couldn't do a moldin
Pops I'm not to happy the way you jackin this Moses
Some dish rap behavior ruins every piece of bash
Though I complain, where's the several action build
You piece of trash, tree or switch
Mo' you buildin, and find your cream's hero
Built it, anything else, you need pharoah
Come to star this, this my crown
One say "How can he" but since not takin any chance
He threw the hooker off the balcony
But word sold out to King, he bank cold cuts blessed
Stripped him of his honors and dumped him in the desert
But I'm return for the people, this chest about saw
King said "You want war? Make brick without straw"
That's a son not being king, and shorty knows good roses
When I be, suppose this the upward knows about Moses

[whistling and samples]

[Slick Rick]
The new King said, S be the threats, filled wit stuffing
Oh boy, what do I do? Now pray to prophet
Then a vision said chill and prophecy fill
Scorm build, hells of fire, or there first born killed
It's gettin scary for the king, he made the sufferin go by Mario
You win, take these peasants and get the fluck outta my area
More villains, still in heat, didn't want my 2 to fill him
Wasn't chillin, then I flat sent the troop to go and kill him
So more, prophecy, when a crossing said run him
Did some ol' abracadabra and water fell upon him
The soldiers that is, since Moses was suave
Then Mo' and the mounds havin a convo wit the father
Came back in the tens, seen panty hoes dropin
Partner suave, folks wasn't into what po-pop was poppin
So the Earth shouldn't kill those, bible takes clothes
Talked about a time when not the worst spit foes and met Moses
