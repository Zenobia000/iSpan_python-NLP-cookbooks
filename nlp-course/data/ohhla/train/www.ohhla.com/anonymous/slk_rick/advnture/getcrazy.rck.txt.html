Artist: Slick Rick
Album:  The Great Adventures of Slick Rick
Song:   Let's Get Crazy
Typed by: Ralphis7@aol.com

{Scratching} get, get, get, get, get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} get, get, get, get, get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} get, get, get, get [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} get, get, get, get, get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]

[Verse One]
Well it's me, and it's time to mingle
So wake up world and bus' out my new single
I take dead bodies and I boost them up live
So straighten up and be alert because the ruler's arrived
No {Not uncle sam} but I can still recruit
As {Hip-hop commander} of the people's troop
So troop be troopers and follow commands
Cuz' {No one can rule like the ruler Rick can}
Though some like it hot and some may like the shock
So let's get together what I mean is rock
No vanity, insanity {Strictly cloud}
Now put your hands together and scream and shout
{Go Slick Rick!} and then go bizerk
But {Keep it at a limit so no one gets hurt}
And don't be boring please not lazy
My jam's packed so let's get crazy

[Chorus]
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} Get, get, get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} Get, get, get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} Get, get, get, get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]

[Verse Two]
The original, that's the title I've earned
Anybody disagreeing been burnt' and learnt'
Told a theif straighten up as I humble hell
And I {Bring a little rhythm} wherever I dwell
Cuz' the door's wide open and I'm taking a chance
As I dip through Europe and I'm going to {France}
Now I always may try and play like full of fun
But in this type of rap I number one
Not number {Two} on a wild-style blizzard
And if I was in the OZ I'd be {Slick Rick the wizzard}
Or some yound man named MC Ricky D
And no fool can say they created me
So wild child, lets go bizerk
But keep it at a limit so no one gets hurt
And don't freeload cuz' I'm not lazy
My jam's packed so let's get crazy

[Chorus]
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} Oh my God!
{Scratching} Oh my God!
{Scratching} Oh my God!
Excuse me Doug E. Fresh {Yes}
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]

[Verse Three]
Well we're in the last station of the final chapter
{Oh Ricky don't go} But you know that I have to
So tell me daily news and all the magazines
{Ricky D's in control} Of what? {Hip-hop scene}
Uptown downtown the man's rated supreme
If Martin Luther were here he'd say {Hey Rick I had a dream}
And if I'm at a jam it must be pumping
People dwell us light cuz' it's them I'm stomping
So y'all be adventurous {Shake and twist}
I insist that this will bring more than just bliss
A posse's and crewies' {Is the size you best}
It's time to get {Stupid}, what I mean is {Fresh}
Hey wild child lets go bizerk
But keep it at a limit so no one gets hurt
And don't be a crumb and try to phase me
My jam's stacked so lets get crazy

[Chorus]
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]
{Scratching} get a lil' stupid [Let's get crazy!]</pre>
