well I've been a public figure for quite a long time
known to the whole world for what [my style of rhyme]
but tonight let's talk about the ones who bite
although they know they won't [never get it right]
because they have no [class] and they have no [shame]
they'll bite another brother to boost their own [name]
get paid correct on a one way gimmick
I'm happy for you lowlifes but 'member there's a limit - so say

teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks kinda easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand that the master will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]
teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks so easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand that the master will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]

when I walk into a party cokesnorters laugh
as the girls be crazy coming for my mere autograph
and it seems that they aspiring my new style of rappin'
and brothers all around me out of vanity are snappin'
the girls say 'wow Rick you're so unique
please tell us how you organize the words you speak'
but my will says chill and I go upon my way
'cause class will be taught some other day - so say

teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks kinda easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand that the ruler will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]
teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks so easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand the ruler will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]

well I remember one night when the world was dead quiet
and out of nowhere some boy starts a riot
he tore my clothes, I had to throw blows
a shotgun barrel was dead on my nose
I froze - it was Big Foot and the Toes
yup, a bunch of small timers that (be it?) on my shows
surrounded the ruler with machetes too
they said um 'if you don't teach us how to rap you're through'
I said 'okay, now let me go, please'
I seen an officer - then the officer screamed 'freeze!'
he said 'Slick Rick you okay?'
I had to play it off, some girls were looking my way
so I smacked one in the face and told him 'I won't retire'
and many years from now I'll just be getting higher
for I am the master, set and done
my name is Ricky D and I'm the only one - so say

[...Ricky D] - [...Ricky D]

now when I was a lad my style was bad
so I had to use what little bit of knowledge that I had
so I quote and I wrote 'till I was up to par
some rhymes were [boo-hoo] and some rhymes were [hahahaa!]
I educate myself so I'm able to reach ya
answering the call of teacher, teacher
tell us how you do it, it's so easy for me
the creator of the style, emcee Ricky D
now my only task is to warn all biters
slimy sluts and fake rhyme writers
don't try your luck and get the ruler annoyed
for when I'm through with you boy your whole world will be destroyed
so chill mister muscle or I'll come and hunt ya
if you are a girl I'll make no man want ya
so if you wanna rule and no (?) in the way
pay attention to my syllables and come see me and say hey hey

teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks so easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand the ruler will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]
teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks kinda easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand that the ruler will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]</pre>
