Artist: Dilated Peoples f/ Guru
Album:  Expansion Team
Song:   Worst Comes to Worst
Typed by: Khadafi662@aol.com

(Babu mixing)
"Worst come to worst my peoples come first"
"Worst...come.....to worst"
"Worst come to worst my peoples come first"
"Worst come...to...worst"
"Worst come to worst my peoples come first"

(Evidence talking)
Yeah
It's goin down y'all
That's Babu

Yo, some people got good friends, at night I live my life right
Intense, on the edge
On the wild, I'm from the group where friction leads to fire
Stack your bricks, the time is take your pick
Do or don't, the track - Alchemist
My life is good, I got my peeps in the mix, so...

   "Worst come to worst my people come first"

(Iriscience)
I got worldwide family all over the earth
And I worry 'bout 'em all for whatever it's worth
From the birth to the hearse, the streets, the guns burst
Words I disperse are here to free minds
And if mine are needy I need to feed mine

   "When worst come to worst..."

(Evidence)
Set up shop and write a verse
Actually (what?), that's best come to best
My lyrics take care of me, they therapy
Get shit off my chest
Extra stress, three-four over the score
Different patterns of rhymin prepare me for war
So next time you see us we'll be deadly on tour

   (Babu mixing)
   "Oh, when you need me"
   "Worst come to worst my peoples come first"

(Guru talking)
Word up, if worst comes to worst, I make whole crews disperse
You know it's family first
Gifted Unlimited with Dilated Peoples
Babu, Evidence, Iriscience
And a shout out to my man Alchemist on the trizzack

   "Oh, when you need me"    
   "Worst come to worst my peoples come first"

(Iriscience)
I'm a glutton for the truth, even though truth hurts
I've studied with my peoples on streets and in church
We make it hard when we go on first
Long road, honor of the samurai code
These California streets ain't paved with gold
Worst comes to worst

       "Worst come to worst my people come first"

(Evidence)
Uh, I got them back, at the end of the day
We could go our seperate ways but the songs remains, it won't change
Got my target locked at range
I might switch gears but first I switch lanes
Without my people I got nothin to gain
That's why...

   "Worst come to worst my people come first"

(Iriscience)
Special victims unit, catalyst for movement
Creates to devastate, since '84 show improvement
Definitely Dilated Peoples comes first
Cross-trainin spar, we raise the bar
And we put it in your ear no matter who you are

   (Babu mixing)
   "Oh, when you need me"
   "Worst come to worst my peoples come first"
   "Worst....come...worst my peoples come first"
   "Worst...worst....worst....come to worst my peoples come first"
   "...my..my...my peoples come first
   "Oh, when you need me"</pre>
