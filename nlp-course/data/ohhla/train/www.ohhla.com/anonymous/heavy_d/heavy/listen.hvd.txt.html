Clear that shit out your ear and just listen
What come on nigga yo come on listen

(Heavy D)
Now we ball out what yall with some pee wee click
Its the biggest nigga you know eyeing your chick
Must be in your blood cause you dying to trick
And it must be brand new cause it dont even fit
So leave all that vulgarious life to me
Cause im the only cat out here thats right to be
Laid out on beaches with sand on the back
But my man soon did hand to hand handling tracks
But all of us together on top of the world
Bond when we click like a string full of pearls
Got big dreams like big ammunition
So people all around Ay Yo you should listen

(Q-Tip)
Come in the jam and do what say Yo Listen
People come around you need to listen
Clear that shit out your ear and just listen
What come on nigga yo come on listen
What say what say what uh listen
Come on everybody say what ay yo listen
Put your hand up in the air ay yo listen
Do this shit with flare ay yo listen

(Heavy D)
What you looking at ay yo you never seen a superstar before
All up in my grill since I walked threw the door
Yall bought tickets when I went out on tour
Now you trying to front like you dont love me no more
Thats cool though see I wanna come threw your town
At the next show watch the Heavy get down
You duck what the F... dont say that
Yall know what I mean Biggie dont play that
Where your loyalty lie for this fly royalty guy do it die
And Im lying in the sky till you well run dry
And your thirsty for fly
Its D your going to be missing so take heed and listen

(Q-Tip)
And, Yo, Do, Listen, Everybody all then around ay yo listen
People in the ghettos and such ay yo listen
Yo, yo my heart you touch ay yo listen
Put your hands up in the sky ay yo listen
Dance cause you know that you fly ay yo listen
Heav D burning the joint ay yo listen
3rd joint yo get the point ay yo listen

(Heavy D)
Yo, yo, yo when I leave the whip what yall notice first
The dime chick or the crusifix
Lets make it bubble we goin' keep it suttle
My name Dwyer my game tight beleive it yall going to hear me tonight
And then some Im handsome with a diva habit
Competition I crush them then I brag about it
Exquisite who is it Heav D and these ladies got a thing for me
And all these R&B chicks be wanting to sing to me
Now fly girls is you with me (Hell Yeah)
And all my dogs is ya with me (Hell Yeah)
On the microphone Heav Corlione shine like chrome
I keep you movin till your ass was scrome
