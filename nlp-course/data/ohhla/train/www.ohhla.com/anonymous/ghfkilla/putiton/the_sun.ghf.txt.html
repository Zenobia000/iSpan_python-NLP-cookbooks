Album:  Put it on the Line
Song:   The Sun
Typed by: DocRZA@aol.com

[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, Good mornin'
Good mooooornin', time to get up

[Ghostface Killah (Raekwon)]
Look at the Sun, so pretty today it's so bright and so smashin'
Blastin', helps out the grass and
Smile when its mornin' time, last night I wrote 3 rhymes
I woke up to the see the Sun shine and
God is my witness in scriptures and pictures
The Sunkist scrumptous, son its nutritious
It makes me wanna climb, take a bite out of shine
"This little light of mine, of mine, of mine"
Yo, the Sun could never be pussy, he always come out
He'll stand right there, even if you pull ya gun out
He can never run out, when the lights go out
It's Japan's turn now, the Earth had spun around
I see yellow and green, its a beautiful thing,
The sky is blue cuz the Sun hit the water like bling
A reflection (uh-huh), and thats all it is (word)
You can't stare at him long cuz your face will do like this

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah (Slick Rick)]
Look who shinnin' again (oh my my my)
We been rhymin' again (oh my my my)
Eye's be blindin' the men (oh my my my)
We come through time and time again (oh my my my)

[Raekwon (Slick Rick)]
Check out my nephew
He jumped up in the window just to see you
Look what he drew, a car-house, always wants to be with you
He's just as jolly, he's always beggin' me to let him see you
I'm like, "probably if you clean up and read a little"
You make people eyes glow,
you got the Weather Channel buggin', and you stuborn when it snow
You my mentor, mothers name they kids after you
New slang, nothin' personal, we knowin' what you been through
(Sun) You roll like one in a million yo
(Sun Sun) You always find like one in the buildin' yo
We'd owe us babies from day one
All I had was you on my birthday, baby think you owe me one
The way the world look when you around
Prisioners get out, look up grin at you, and then kiss the ground
You my favorite, I wish we had 3 more of you
I adore you, plus I even wrote a story for you

[Chorus]

[Slick Rick]
How a diverse Sun, can be enrichenin' and cruel
Reachin' the full 98, and got the kids in the pool
Isn't it cool how it spreads joy, hun's lay in it
and it's hard to go back to work, when your lunch break's finished
Ah strike and I fought, so it's a fact I support
Feelin' the warm sunrays, upon your back as you walk
The heat driven, a theory I clung to deep with it
Is souls have to go through the Sun to reach heaven and
Sense and retreat, our souls battered to seek
Madam believe since dinosaurs, and Adam and Eve
That Sun's hovered to the extermination of us
It's a peephole which leads to the firmament above us

[RZA]
Who can take a rain drop and turn it to glee?
And drawn up 6 miles, over tropical isles and bring it to the sea?

[Chorus]</pre>
