[Verse 1: Duet MC Ren and Rakim]
I was a fiend, before I became a teen
I melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream
Music orientated, so when Hip-Hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
cause I grabbed the mic and try to say, " yes y'all!"
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small
Cool, cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet
Back to the lab, without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the other one, then I make another one
To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a cravin' like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and
Don't it sound amazing cause every rhyme is made and
thought of, cause it's sort of
an addiction, magnatized, by the mixin'
Vocals, vocabulary, your verses, you're stuck in..

[Hook: DJ Eric B scratching and cutting]
gangster..gangster..
