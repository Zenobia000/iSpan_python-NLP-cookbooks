Artist: Betty Wright & The Roots f/ Lil Wayne
Album:  Betty Wright: The Movie
Song:   Grapes on a Vine
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com (w/ help from liner notes)

[Intro: Betty Wright]
Ooooh (Oh, oh, oh)
Mmmmm (oh, oh)
Oh (Oh, oh)
Ohhhh-whoa
(Oh...oh-oh...)

[Betty Wright]
Daddy always told me to be real  
Daddy always said that, I should say just what I feel 
People, they will judge you cause they just don't understand  
You're in it for the long ride, you don't just give up on a man 
And like every woman who's been through the fire as well  
We ALL got a story half afraid to tell, yeah  
People they will judge you 'cause they just can't comprehend  
You're headed for the long ride, you don't just give up on a friend  

[Pre-Chorus Bridge]
(Now the ones have moved on) Gone to where the sun shines all the time  
(We're still standing) Though some might think we've lost our minds  
(We shall fulfill) our legacy divine 
It's just that we're so different, makes our place a little harder to find  

[Chorus]
Grapes on a vine (Grapes on a vine) don't always make sweet wine 
Grapes on a vine, yeah, don't always make sweet wine 
Grapes on a vine (Grapes on a vine) don't always make sweet wine 
Might be bitter, but it gets better with time 

[Betty Wright] (Lil Wayne)
Momma always said that, it's okay to dream  
Momma always warned me things ain't always what they seem (and my momma told me...) 
People, they will judge you; leave you sittin' on a shelf  
Remember it's a long ride, just don't you give up on yourself  
And like every man, who wants to make his mark 
We ALL got a secret hidden in our hearts, yeah {We all got a secret}  
People they will judge us, 'cause they just don't really see  
We're in it for the long ride, just don't you give up on you and me, no~!

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Uh, uh
Grapes on a vine, ain't nuttin' sweet
You gotta pay the price, just keep your receipt
I can make the world have a seat on my feet
And I come from New Orleans where the water too deep
Money bring problems, the funny thang 'bout it
Everybody want it, want it 'til they got it
Sometimes I forget and put my trouble in my pockets
Then hang up my pants, now I got monsters in my closet
Get right with me, Miss Wright with me
Die hard, I got too much life in me
Shades on, I'm seein past that
Bittersweet wine, where your glass at?
Toast! You haters are ghost
I make y'all sick, you need a full dose, ha~!
And my momma told me do me
and stay away from that fruit tree, because..

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro] (Lil Wayne)
{Do you, do you}
So do you, do you, do yooooooooooou...
(Miss Wright with me) Be your own best friend
(Miss Wright with me) Be your own best friend
(Miss Wright with me, Miss Wright with me) Be your own best friend
(Miss Wright, Miss Wright, Miss Wright with me)
You gotta love on you before anybody else can learn to
You gotta love you, LOVE you, yeaaaaah, love you, love you</pre>
