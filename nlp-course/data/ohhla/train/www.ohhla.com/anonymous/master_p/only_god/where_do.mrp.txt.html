Artist: Master P f/ Mac, Nas, Sons of Funk
Album:  Only God Can Judge Me
Song:   Where Do We Go From Here
Typed by: SouljaSno@aol.com

Master P talking: 

This goes out to all the soldiers out there 
All the fallen soldiers, all my soldiers seeking conviction
Keep your head up and look to the stars for strength 
ya heard me? (Hoody Hoo)
Don't let nothing hold you back 
Keep your eyes on your enemies 
and just remember a wise man learn, but a fool never will
it aint no limit soldiers

Verse 1: (Master P)

Dear Brother, I should I say soldiers of all colors
where we went wrong I wrote this love song for ya 
Let me begin to tell ya how I love ya
and if your heart is anything like mine soldier I die for ya
You never met me but you felt my presence
Your father, Your son, your brother that's my essence
I'm only human so I stress like you, and I'm just like you, 
and someday I gotta leave this flesh like you
We all part of a plan that we would never truly understand
in convictions, seeking confessions, but confused by the devil's hand
and no of us was born killers and thieves, 
but its the evil we instill in the seed
Am I soldier cause I run against the seed wodie?
Don't nothing truly exist but your dreams wodie
and any times I find myself worshiping the morning 
But when you catch me off track just put me back on it 
with ya love....

Chorus: Sons of Funk, (Master P)

All my soldiers is all I have 
(Where do we go from here)
All the bad times we went through
everyday our dreams come true
(Where do we go from here)
You need me and I need you
(Lord tell me where do we go from here)
Change your ways you have time
(Lord tell me where do we go from here)

Verse 2: (Nas)

Check it out
I bought this two tickets to see these No Limit movies 
_Foolish_ _I Got The Hook Up!_ , me and my baby far from a hooker
It's good to see young men doing something right with their life
could be a the next Spielberg, I supported it I enjoyed it that night
We thug millionaries, everywhere, you look we ballin'   
but there always gotta be somebody stupid to spoil it 
I call it, everytime I see it, it gets me heated
this fake thugging, actin like they can't bleep shit
Another coward I gotta bury, I'm hot on you secondary,
we vow that you lesser than me
we last forever, mask together,
No Limit, Ill Will, Queensbrigde, killers cash forever
You feel this, have my whole projects on an airplane to kill shit
Made nigga before the money, killers taking all this from me
But I learned how to chill, now I'm rightfully living
Cause the clowns out here get you life in the prison.....Man

Chorus:

All my soldiers is all I have 
(Where do we go from here)
All the bad times we went through
everyday our dreams come true
(Where do we go from here)
You need me and I need you
(Lord tell me where do we go from here)
Change your ways why you have time
(Lord tell me where do we go from here)

Verse 3: (Mac)

Now to you living mothers, havin' hell raising you brothers
cause the baby's daddy don't love ya
You still a queen ole' girl, don't let him get you down
Just do your thing if he real he gonna come around
but if he don't then you don't need him, 
he man enough to make 'em but not man enough to feed 'em
and it kills him to see you suceeding
so keep your head in the clouds, bump this love song loud
and every bow, with your girls feeling proud
your heaven-sent, 
and I don't understand how you settle for the scrubs it was never meant
You can do better by your lonely, there's nothing like being free
and it's never to late so baby go get your G.E.D
If you believe in you like I know you believe in me 
then we can live in peace and no longer this misery
your world don't stop, and ain't no limit to trys
and just remember this dark is just some light in disguise
and my childern say Woah...

Chours: 

All my soldiers is all I have 
(Where do we go from here)
All the bad times we went through
everyday our dreams come true
(Where do we go from here)
You need me and I need you
(Lord tell me where do we go from here)
Change your ways why you have time
(Lord tell me where do we go from here)

All my soldiers is all I have 
(Where do we go from here)
All the bad times we went through
everyday our dreams come true
(Where do we go from here)
You need me and I need you
(Lord tell me where do we go from here)
Change your ways why you have time
(Lord tell me where do we go from here)

(Master P talking)

Wassup soldiers yall keep ya'll's heads up
It's hard times, we spread love
from ghetto's everywhere
from the south, to the east. to the world 
wassup Nas, wassup Mac
we got chase our dreams, I'm chasing mines
Picture me in tha NBA
Picture me still living
Picture us all making changes 
That's where we go from here</pre>
