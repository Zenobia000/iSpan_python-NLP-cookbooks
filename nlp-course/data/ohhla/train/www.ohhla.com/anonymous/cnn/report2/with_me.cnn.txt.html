Artist: Capone-N-Noreaga f/ Nas
Album:  The War Report 2: Report the War
Song:   With Me
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus 1: Nas - 2X]
Niggas, y'all be with me to the end
Real niggas that convince me, we true friends
From the streets to penitentiary, they my mans
For you I let my clips empty, you understand?

[Noreaga]
Half gal' of Henny liquor fuck up my liver
I could do without it, I smoke sour
And yeah I'm God body, I'm in tune with the objects
Dead pictures under the benches in all projects
And I don't care what the mayor say
It's a recession, they putting bricks on layaway
And sometimes I wan' stay away
and change my jumpshot back to a fadeaway
But everything okay today
Tomorrow ain't promised though, and you should know it's not
Hit the church, hit the mosque, go pray and meet Salam
I ain't tryna kick knowledge and get all religious
Spit razors out my mouth, give your face stitches
Coupes with the deep dishes, leather seat posture
No love for the coppers, no love for the rockers
I'm authentic, organic, I recognise imposters

[Chorus 1: Nas - 2X]

[Nas]
Yo, if my niggas got drama, I'll murder for them
I get caught, I say "Your Honor, I murdered that man"
God forbid, my niggas die, then I'll murder for them
For every one of mine you take I'm killing ten of your men
My niggas struggling, share the same pain as me
Stay thugging cause they share the same pain as me
On the corner slinging dope, serving fiends like me
Watching for police, dodging the same thing as me
If my niggas get caught, they know I'll be there
Look behind your shoulder in trial, I'll be there
Help you post bail when you sentenced, I'll be there
I'll hold fort till you come back, I solemnly swear
Fuck models when you come out, pop bottles when you come out
At the gate pick you up, you drive the Hum' out
License plate, registration, suitcases full of big faces
If I ain't got it, then we bout to take it

[Chorus 2: Nas - 2X]
All my niggas rolling with me to the end
Real niggas that convince me, we true friends
From the streets to penitentiary, they my mans
For you I let my clips empty, you understand?

[Capone]
True friends nigga, CNN, God's Son
Fo'-fo' silencers, we duct tape a witness up
Everybody dying just to beat a murder trial
Favor for a favor, that's how I'm on it
You wet mine, I wet yours, no money exchanged, that's consignment on it
I send a wreath to foes with condolences
Emotionless when I'm squeezing, easy to focus kid
A loyal nigga like Kane and Purnell
My gangsta is too heavy, try to weigh it on a scale
From the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable
For my niggas, ain't no telling who I'll give it to
We the same blood type? I'll give my liver too
Revenge is a promise, that shit is biblical
I got five, you got two and a half though
We split everything down the middle like ash yo
You don't fuck with none of my niggas then don't speak to me
Frequently I like to +Buckshots+ like Evil Dee

[Chorus 2: Nas - 2X]</pre>
