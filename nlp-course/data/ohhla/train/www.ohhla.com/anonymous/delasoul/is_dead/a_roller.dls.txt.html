Artist: De La Soul f/ Q-Tip
Album:  De La Soul is Dead
Song:   A Roller Skating Jam Named "Saturdays"
   
   (And rollerskates)
   (And rollerskates)
   (And rollerskates)
   
   Q-TIP:
   Girl meets boy on Thursday night
   Boy was high, girl fly like kite
   They hold hands until next day
   Boy then lets go, hit his way
   Boy rules butt, brags to his boys
   Erection brings bad boy joys
   Boy thinks of that big fat back
   Big black fat love, big black fat
   Girl calls boy to stand him up on Saturday
   Saturday
   
   POS AND Q-TIP:
   Saturday, it's a Saturday
   It's a Saturday, it's a Saturday
   Saturday, it's a Saturday
   Saturday, it's a Saturday
   
   POS:
   Back once more with the wallop in the score
   Must I ride and rip, should I make you rock your hip
   Reviver of a roller-boogie in a rink
   And sure to make you think about the times
   To scope fun instead of fights
   (But diving from a piece of metal sure to take your life)
   Yo, slip your butt to the fix of this mix
   Toss that briefcase, it's time to let loose
   'Cause you've worked like heck to get the week in check
   So unfasten that noose around your neck
   Connected like a vibe from the wheel to the foot
   Come on everybody dig the funky output
   
   VINIA:
   Five days you work
   One whole day to play
   Come on everybody, wear your rollerskates today
   It's Saturday, Saturday
   Saturday, it's Saturday
   Saturday, it's Saturday
   Saturday, it's Saturday-ay
   (Is the word, is the word, is the word)
   
   POS:
   Now as you pump your fist I reminisce
   To a bounce, rock, skate, roll
   Fess to impress
   Hey, pretty diamond, do you like the way I'm dressed
   Cool, keep the faith and be my mate
   'Cause all we need is feet
   (And rollerskates)
   But promote the hustle 'cause it keeps me thin
   No need to talk, look who just walked in
   
   DOVE:
   (Is there a Dred on skates?)
   Yes, man
   (So kick the wham on this jam)
   Oh Mr. Sprinkler, Mr. Sprinkler
   Wet me for one, Mr. Sprinkler
   I'm heatin' high-five in a daze, no split
   With a yawn I trip to the dawn
   Out comes the bodies following the one idea
   It's clear, rattle to the roll
   Hold back up the track, grab your rollerskates y'all
   And let's zip on by
   Zip-a-de-doo-dah, let's zip on by
   Feed on a weed and we're feeling high
   Sun is on thick and the cheese is rollin' quick
   Come on, there's no time to hide
   Season is twist, spinning and winning
   No hackeysack, let let me in
   Spill on the bottom away, but it's okay, huh
   It's a Saturday
   
   POS:
   Now let's all get baked like Anita
   
   Q-TIP:
   Watch Mr. Lawnge, don't look at the peter
   
   DOVE:
   Feel on the fun, I'll feel on the
   
   VINIA:
   Hey, watch that!
   
   DE LA SOUL:
   It's a Saturday
   
   VINIA:
   Now is the time
   To act the fool tonight
   Forget about your worries and you will be all right
   It's Saturday, Saturday
   Saturday, it's Saturday
   Saturday, it's Saturday
   Saturday, it's Saturday-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
   (Aaoww)
   
   (Saturday)
   (Saturday)
   (Saturday)
   (Saturday)
   (Saturday)
   (Saturday)
   (Saturday)
   (Saturday)
