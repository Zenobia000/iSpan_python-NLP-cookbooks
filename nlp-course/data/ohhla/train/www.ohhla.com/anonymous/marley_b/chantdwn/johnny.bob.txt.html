Artist: Bob Marley f/ Guru
Album:  Chant Down Babylon
Song:   Johnny Was
Typed by: Goldiggiz@hotmail.com

(Bob Marley)
The unity must have to start now
Because I mean, how long would we have to suffer?
Let us learn these things that we must be united

(Guru)
That's right
Truly, we're involved in a struggle
So what we go'n do?
We gotta make it right for our people
For our forefathers and mothers
That's right (must be united)
For the seeds (must be united)
Spiritual warriers (must be united)

(Bob Marley)
Woman hold her head and cried
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
>From a stray bullet
Woman hold her head and cried
Explaining to her was a passer by who
Saw the woman cry
Wondering
How can she work it out (how can she work it out)
Now she knows not the wager of turning them
Her gift of love is life
She cried

(Chorus) (singing girls)
Oh ummm how
Johnny was a good man
How 
Johnny was a good good good good good good good
Good good good good good good man
Johnny was a good man
She cried
She cried

(Guru)
Any attempt to change my stance son, would be futile
Ma, things for you would never get easier ooooow child
Supreme the colour scheme
Why brothers die with dirty cream
They avoid their dreams
But they obtained by worthy beings
Homicide statistics, obituary colums
Numerous things listed 
Different violent types of behaviour depicted
They murdered my bredren
He was a good man
Protected his fam, we all respected this man
Still his life got held up like liquor stores
Or old school jams
What goes around re-surfaces
Now is it worth it kid?
Do you really wanna get out the game?
I know you nervous kid
Hot and caught up
Like my boy Bokeem in the flick
Plus we know reality is much more worse and much more sick
Your cerebral eye probe vocals, can't touch your ear-lobes
Destroyin all microbes
The ill dynamic psycho
Analyst, so understand it this
Beautiful world as we know it, is definately at risk
Righteous soldiers professed to be triumphant at battle
Loud cries from the cell, many cages rattle
Fire radiates heat, ice radiates cold
I radiate thoughts and ideas all things wit in my control
Some men travel down twisted roads
And innocent lives get lost
May Ja, bless his soul

(Bob Marley [singing girls])
Johnny was a good man
How
Never did a thing wrong
How
Johnny was a good man
Kinda woman's tender care, keep cryin
These two was the child she bare
Oh, a woman's tender care
Seem to all the child she bare
Woman cry just like I am there

(Guru)
Word is bond he was a good man
So is my man BIG
Rest in peace BIG
So is my man Pac'
Rest in peace Pac' (Rest in peace Pac)
So was so many other brothers
Too numerous to mention (To numerous to mention)
Time is now (Time is now)
For us to fight for what is ours, rightfully
As was prophisised from the beginging
So shall it be (So shall it be)</pre>
