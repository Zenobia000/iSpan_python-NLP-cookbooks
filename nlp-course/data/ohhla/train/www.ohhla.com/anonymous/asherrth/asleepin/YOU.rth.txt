"You are not someone else, someone else is someone else
You are you, it is you, you are you"

[Slick Rick]
Slick Rick and Asher is on this jam
Slick Rick and Asher is on this jam "You are you"
Slick Rick and Asher is on this jam
"It is you, you are you, you are you"

[Chorus: Asher Roth & Slick Rick]
There's nothing, that you can do about it
The one thing that I've figured out is "you are you"
Forget it, there's no way around it
"It is you, you are you, you are you"

[Asher Roth]
No matter what I do to try and fit in
There's nothing I can do about this body I was given
I'm blond and I am skinny, with my mom's ? skin
The Scotter side, and my father schnoz to go with it
Nice nose, my hair, yeah I can try and dye it
And contacts could change the color of my eyes but "you are you"
That would only mean that I am lying
And openly denying it's not who, who I am
I try to be too big for my britches
And couldn't, regardless of my Skee-Lo wishes
A couple more inches and I would be in business
But still I'm waking up 5'10 every Christmas "you are you"
My fingerprints is what makes me different
It took a little bit, but I can finally admit it
This is my appearance, this is my face
Looking in the mirror there is nothing I can change
Might be a little strange, the way you can see my veins
But if we were the same, the world would be plain vain
It would be lame, you would never learn a thing
So go against the grain, and let these people know your name "you are you"

[Chorus 2X]

[Slick Rick]
Dog kiss culprits, all getting a girl
Due to hip hop invisible pulping off the wall
Nothing to play with, skipping all the way with
It conveying who we all are, how we all fit in this mosaic
Portrait, thesis of a brother
Homosexual being last pieces of the puzzle
All religion who read divine pine verse
Could God once pray, folks get their mind right first
Then weed out, legitimate seed crop
? with ? feed like intrigue why
And politics, harvest the chatter
Dissect good from garbage that'll matter "you are you"
Now I doubt you, but allowed to
What amounts to, that's just what adults do
Keeping with the pace of barbarian
Keeping goldy jewels in the face of American "you are you"

[Chorus 2X]

[Asher Roth]
Besides, it's all about your mind
Your will and your drive, and what's going on inside
The size of your heart is what sets you apart
If you aren't using it, I suggest that you start "you are you"
Think hard, take a walk around the block "you are you"
It's cool if you're a nerd, or a jock
Or a prep, or a goth, nobody gives a fuck
There's nothing you can do, just stop, just stop, man
Mad props since I linked up with Knotts
Still never wear socks, always in flip flops
No chain or a watch, I be slinging no rocks
But my slang be the thang that be saving hip hop (he's good)
Screw the box, go outside the lines
Just be you, stop with the trying
And in due time, it is true you will find
There is nothing to remember if you never ever lie "you are you"

[Chorus 2X]
