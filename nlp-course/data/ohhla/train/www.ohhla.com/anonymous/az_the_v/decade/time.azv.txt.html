[Nature]
At the ripe age of 24, I've done seen it all, done it all
Some dreams stay fresh and some are spoiled
Dealing with time, went to Spring, Summer, Fall
It's crazy changes, Is this that made me famous?
I come a long way from Timbs, minimum wages 
Stocking caps, summer jobs pocket's flat
It's funny how my childhood idol's now be coping cracks
Ain't knocking at them, fortunately life's too short to see
It's only right we move accordingly at every second
I use to carry heavy weapons, previously cocked
Tucked in my shirt for every session, but hold up
The two to six beer made me grow up
Came home to the damn same dreams with no luck
And half the clique's strong, the other half moved on
Some with new lives and new wives, niggas live long
The foulest thing about time is, it still ticks when you're gone

[Nas]
For those who lived the way I've lived, we've came from a long way
From wiping coal from our eye lids to raps hottest
Smoking lye and let track guide us, remember back then
Before Mack 10's expensive bottles, had a sick mind
Niggas taught me how to get mine
We've often sit courts, they get tossed that spit line
To all niggas that the Lord seemed to legit for their time
While we plan to live for-ever he had a different design
Is it safe to say, we all parish on the sacred day?
With my luck soon as I reach the gate that made me pay, pray
Minutes go by indo go high the specialist
Decked out dark specks, finesse in it
Used to play catch a kiss, same girls back then
now leave us messages, a whole lot
Travel to my old spot, where we sold rock, although it's trifle
Ain't nothing changed, just like time it's all a cycle

[AZ]
Yo, wake up to the world stay in charge of your dream
Keep your vision, focus, get wise and largen your cream
Marketing schemes, so many in the dark, it's unseen
Caught in between, perhaps rap was a fortunate thing
Forced to be king from hustling, supporting them fiends
Busting guns, I had no remorse as a teen
Rocking birth stones, my first, get bent nurse the dome
It hurts to zone, now I've realized, I'm on this Earth alone
Time ticks, devilish mind design tricks
Leave you blind quick and 'cause you to die behind shit
Mathematics, master 120, I'm Asiatic, amazed with magic
'Cause  it's illusions that made me savage
Life changes once you establish the right game
Love the night rain found a new way to fight pain
Clocks never stop, it's all a race to the top
Trying to freeze, that's why I iced the face of my watch</pre>
