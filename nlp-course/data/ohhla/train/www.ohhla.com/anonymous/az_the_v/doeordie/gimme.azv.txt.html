Artist: AZ the Visualiza f/ Nas
Album:  Doe or Die
Song:   Gimme Your's
Typed by: davpaul@dove.net.au, dopeskill@gmail.com

[Intro: Nas]
Gimme, just gimme, for the NYC
Gimme what you can't get back
Gimme, why don't you gimme the world
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five boroughs

[Verse 1: AZ]
Yo, it's hard to show resistance when money getting niggas
Need my assistance to stack figures, beyond non-existence
Fuck keepin my distance, cos bein poor produced persistence
Plus plea's, a hundred G's, I had me blockin out of jail sentence
I'm recognized by the illest of individuals
Killers and criminals, even willies that's really into jewels
But still sceptic on who I cling to
Cos every single nigga that swing through ain't my man just cos we mingle
To mistake shit, even females be feedin off that fake shit
Filled with envy and hatred but my high helps me escape it
Temporarily, though it don't worry me
The wise verbally nourish me, properly with that inner city, urban GC
I fuck with those beyond my age bracket
Cos they analyze and map it, get the papers and stack it
Leavin no trace to track it, keep on thinkin tappers is accurate
That mack shit, livin the lifestyle, we feel relaxed with

[Chorus: Nas] + (AZ)
Just gimme (Pimp lines and dollar signs)
Just gimme (Rollin trees, stackin G's)
Gimme what you can't get back (True dat, I thought you knew that)
Just gimme (Money getters, the high bidders)
Why don't you gimme the world (rollin wit us)
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five burroughs

[Verse 2: AZ]
So in God I trust, I lust for a 850-deluxe
And in two, I touch a million-plus, ain't much to discuss
Diamonds and double-digits, Gianni Versace down with lizards
It's realism so I visualize it to live it
Movin cleverly, with intentions of longevity
Strong pedigree got me touchin papers, others would never see, G
So do the crest in my claw, flourescents
symbolises the essence, you're sailin in a sweppervescence
Drug investments, a street thug's plug, the insurance, but informers
They had you wanted for warrants 'fore you get enourmous
Life's a performance so players play with endurance
Cos for more cents, any villain's willing to get more intense
They tried to break us but all it did was just make us
travel across acres for papers, bonafide money takers
Cos though we know somehow we all gotta go
As long as we're leaving thieving, we'll be leaving wit some kind of doe,
so...

[Chorus: Nas] + (AZ)
Just gimme (Pimp lines and dollar signs)
Just gimme (Rollin trees, stackin G's)
Gimme what you can't get back (True dat, I thought you knew that)
Just gimme (Money getters, the high bidders)
Why don't you gimme the world (rollin wit us)
Gimme what you can't get back (It's real, NYC)

Just gimme (QB)
Just gimme (B-K, VT)
Gimme what you can't get back (See me, AZ y'all, representin)
Just gimme (Yeah, the street life is trife life)
Why don't you gimme the world (Representin)
Gimme what you can't get back (Life's a bitch and then you die)</pre>
