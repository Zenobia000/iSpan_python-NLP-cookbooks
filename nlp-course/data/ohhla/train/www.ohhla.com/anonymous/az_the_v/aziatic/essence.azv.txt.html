[A] but I'ma hit you as soon as I'm right over there
[A] Right in front right? (yeah) Okay, aight gotchu

[N] Son who laced you with the ill haircut?
[A] Lenny, he blessed me with the sharp blade, that nigga's paid

[A] You hotter with them frames on
[N] Nigga you James Bond, and you stay low
[A] Y'know my style babe bro (yeah, make dough)
[N] Manicure, facial, face glow
[A] Fuck it if you say so; I keep you P.I.!
[N] That's how we break hoes
[N] We throwin ivory dice across the concrete
[A] And of course that don't make him your man because y'all palm weed
[N] We had boxed bumpin La-Di-Da-Di (word?)
[N] Shotties was blastin, pellets jumpin into everybody
[A] They never got me
[A] Was cool with all the park shooters, sparkin bazookas
[A] Sharpen your tutors, cause we don't pardon the snoozers
[N] Yo son I wouldn't change my life for nuttin
[A] And that ain't like you for frontin
[N] Who's the nicest? (Nuff talkin, light somethin)

[Chorus: Nas + AZ]
Yo we hard hit, just like Comacho and Vargas
Who's the target? Now watch how we close the market
We both hard hit, just like Hagler and Hearns
Add the math, be concerned, if it's beef you burn
Yo it's sorta like, Poitier and Bill Cosby
'Let's Do It Again,' a beautiful blend, let's do it to win
My nigga - my nigga - my niggaz - my niggaz
My niggaz - my niggaz - uhh..

[N] What's today's mathematics?
[A] We had it, we let 'em hold it, we shoulda sold it
[N] We back it, we could grabbed it
[N] But fuck it, just let 'em have it
[A] Al 'Humdulillah
[N] Allahu Akbar
[A] God is the greatest
[N] Planet Mars, we carvin the faces
[A] You couldn't catch us in a car without the bangers
[A] Believe, I touched a couple of movie stars and entertainers
[N] Indeed, one in particular, almost started to name her (ha ha)
[N] I was there when you first pushed up and started to game her
[A] Been a long journey, certain shit just don't concern me
[N] They ain't hurtin shit; we flip, they hire attorneys
[A] Yo I'ma stay custom, 'til I'm old grey and rustin
[A] Reminiscin the number of chickens that claim we fucked 'em
[N] Bet some badda hoes than them other funky rappers chose
[N] I'm tryin to wife a chick, light a spliff (okay)
[N] This might be like another part to "Life's a Bitch"
[A] Write ya lips, who's nice as this?  We righteousness
[A] No mic assists, it's murderous - granted the right to flip

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Nas]
Like, Spinks and Hearns..
Sorta.. Poitier and Bill Cosby
'Let's Do it Again,' nigga..</pre>
