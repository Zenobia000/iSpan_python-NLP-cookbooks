Song:   Take Cover
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Take cover (cause shit could go down for real)
Take cover (do you hold a pound for real?)
Take cover (cause you could hit the ground for real)
Take cover (and never hear a sound for real)

Late night you hear the gun spark, it's dumb dark
Fight for life, in the ghetto, gave me a numb heart
The one part, that y'all bitches missed
is how a hardcore thug could switch up and slit his wrists
The other kid across town, bucked his own self down
Stress'll make a nigga a mess, so I don't play around
Like Big Shug said, you _Fuck Around_ you _Lay Around_
Catch a _Moment of Truth_ like slugs from a four pound
Headz know, aiyyo I blaze tracks strictly
State facts officially, mad dimes wanna get with me
Let me mention, me and Premier, livin legends
Blessin every mic I touch, relievin tension (for real)
just like shiatsu massage
Put your career on freeze, +No Guarantees+ like Chico DeBarge
So you should move with apprehension or get fenced in
Surround by a +Union+ of thugs, ready to put dents in
your body, lace you from head to toe
I give the right signal, niggaz be ready to throw
So knock that shit off, stop playin games, I run the game
I maintain while other lame-ass cats fucked up in game
On the wall of shame, endin up as a no-name
While I'm reppin in the motherfuckin hall of game
Still I'm knowin exactly when suckers wanna get at me
Thinkin they can attack me, I shut down the head of the faculty
The others could get smothered, word to mother
Aiyyo it's Bald Head Slick, about to flip so take cover

Take cover (cause shit could go down for real)
Take cover (do you hold a pound for real?)
Take cover (cause you could hit the ground for real)
Take cover (and never hear a sound for real)

Take cover (cause shit could go down for real)
Take cover (do you hold a pound for real?)
Take cover (cause you could hit the ground for real)
Take cover (and never hear a sound for real)</pre>
