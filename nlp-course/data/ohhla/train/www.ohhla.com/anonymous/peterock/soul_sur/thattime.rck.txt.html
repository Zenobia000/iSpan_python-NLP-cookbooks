Album:  Soul Survivor
Song:   It's About That Time
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Over the globe again from the realm of illadelph
The planet overwhelmed yo just brace yaself
Ya wanna go against me first face yaself i pose threat
To whoever within ya commonwealth the top ten
I'm crushing ya crap concoction
To the utmost examine this upclose it's shockin 
Now mic droppin is only ya option
Here come the spliff scientist in the flesh have you forgotten
His excellency the most poetically inventive official hip hop shit
That's ya incentive to cop this actual fact and not the likeness
Cuz possibly clones 'd try to do it like this
Fathom this lyrically fabulous vocabulist 
Hold mic like four fifth and lick shot somewhat like pete
Malik rock think not i don't smoke i just sleep drink and eat 
Think pot and i want the top a vehicle that brakes 
God i want the top a vehicle that brinks got composing 
To the ink sock my hip hop is wild megawatts 
Continue with forever exist and never stop
Yo whut up whatever ock we can thicken tha plot because

And it's time for that and it's about that time
It's time for that and it's about that time
Rob 0 it's time for that and it's about that time
Pete Rock it's time for that and it's about that time
Black Thought it's time for that and it's about that time

[Rob O]
I'm Rob 0 what, energize like a power plant blow speakers 
Without an amp do things these wack rappers can't 
And start again 33 rpm the hearts of men 
Are cold like the steel i hold on microphones 
Let my words express move men like chess 
My mic will stand erect like projects 
It's drastic top draft pick in this rap shit 
You just a fraction caught up in tha midst of action 
My catalog is current events breath the contents 
What i move crowds for local events the show stopper 
98 feature spot rocker rob odendo 
Now every mc wanna mention me out of envy 
Unofficially top of the charts i played my part 
Held it down from the start you know the M.O.
Yeah yeah Rob Odendo

Chorus

[Pete Rock]
Yo it's the Capital P book rhymes of the century 
Speak rap line essientially on tha M-I-C
I hold the mic appliance like science 
My competitors and clients worldwide as my words coincide 
With real life think twice transmit like true lies
It's televised take my manuscripts out of context 
Who want next situation is complex
Stop the nonsense it's 98 time to set the record straight 
Separate movers and shakers from those that hesitate
Ya featherweight name carry weight in every state
Ya name brand no frills niggaz is marinate 
It's pete rock new world innovator 
Crush immitators five years since the creator
It's nuff said as i paint the town red and move ahead

Chorus
