[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Classic shit, timeless
Forever, iconic
DJ Khaled!
 
[Nas]
Uhh, a divine leader, shine brighter, bonita mami meet a
line sniffer, never, poetic rhyme writer, chiefer
Ebony empress getter, "Celebrity Apprentice" a devil show
Big up to Africa, Mexico
Hennessy, margarita, venison eater
So dear spread 'em here, don't be actin' innocent either
Dome me, relax me, it's only to the nasty, I'm just a phony assassin
A lot of niggas owe me, I'ma tax 'em
A lot of sisters hold me to somethin' holy and Catholic
Cause the rosary and gold flashy
Just an attachment and accessory to my dress code
Now everywhere, all I see is Pablo, Esco
Last time I checked I was still breathin'
My neck was still freezin', now everybody got an Escobar season
To every baby on the album cover existin'
This trend I was settin' it came to fruition
I'm assistin' to push the culture forward to all my go supporters
Go support us like a local black-owned grocery store
Cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood
It's a dub on that, we get government aid
Spend it at they stores, puttin' they kids through college
We need balance, so we can lease and own deeds in our projects
So I'm askin' Gs to go in their pockets
The racial economic inequality, let's try to solve it
 
[Chorus: Nas]
My signature fade with the bevel blade
That's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal
I like that, that's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself
That's a major key
What Tony had on the table
It's like us, we a major key
 
[Nas]
Still underestimated, every mistake a lesson, Mercury retrograde
So if that planet spin backwards up in the heavens maybe
It's effectin' back on niggas who don't be reppin' lately
I'm playin' chess with babies
Niggas is nursery, niggas impersonatin', rehearsin' me
Nothin' like me, I'm the first of me and that's quite certainly
So official, come get this issue, some women crazy
I like a woman to show me wisdom
These hoes easily convinced to pop their pussy with a loaded pistol
"Y'all ain't meant to be played", says the brother with the signature fade
Still paid, stackin', new stash
Went from hangin' with shooters and clappers to computer hackers
Check the fashion in Monaco
Gettin' ocean mist on my HSTRY hats
Khaled called me when I was in album mode so I put it on hold for the "Major Key"
My album done niggas, wait and see
 
[Interlude: DJ Khaled]
Classic shit, timeless
Forever, iconic
 
[Chorus]</pre>
