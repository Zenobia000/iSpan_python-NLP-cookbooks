[Intro: Raekwon] (Statik Selektah sample)
(Statik Selektah!) Let's do this man for real

[Verse One: Raekwon]
We smoke big blunts cigars is us
It's obvious kids we regulate up shit movin through crush
The beats is grim the ambiance plush
The speaker won't bang the sneaker won't lust
Snitches wish that the eagle 'gon bust
Catch you in the wrong spot you dust
Statik yo, bring that habit this is magic
Fake niggas flee out, fly out the mouth I get you gatted
Sports cars we endorse yards
Everybody four stars Rae like forty, Jerry Gordy
Your creature game corny, I eat your dame hop up on me
Head off the rip, grab the whip rest maturely
Hang around the vets in the sweats
Since '97 we was rolexin the extra
Fuck around a hundred teks flash flex cash
Drugs money and sex, dumb checks smashin

[Verse Two: Joey Bada$$]
Watchin the game from a bird's eye view
They say it's hard to keep trust so my third eye grew
Chakras open, binocular scopin, sour smokin
Hopin my best buzz, ain't only in it for the tokens
Cause, they say if who you jokin with, chokin potent with
Tag-team and strokin chicks, the ones who do some bogus should
Act cool on the strip, but want to put two on your hip
Mackin jewels in your whips, boomin your hits and screwin your bitch
Froze under my toes, bitches where my penis is
Kickin it since the womb, now you, see what the fetus is
And what the fetus is? Would these niggas feed us shit?
Rob a nigga for his number 2's to put my feet in, shit
Flow slippery, rise to the tippity top
I'ma make hot drops, snakes stakes history
Dreams of livin civilly in Sicily
Laughing with a fan like

[Verse Three: Black Thought]
It's the elephant in the room
Created by a collision of the sun and the moon
My sonogram was an image of a gun in the womb
That was soon, to be doper than her-on in a spoon
I'm astonishin, honestly my future lookin promisin
As my skin tone and a crystal-clean onyx is
Darker thoughts let the beats break like the Amish's
I'm a stroke of genius like, Mickalene Thomas is
Hip-Hop and body rockin, doin it dude
I am a livin definition of improvin the groove
I use the same tools to shoot, that Ku-b-rick used
Take your hero to the river, give him two b-rick shoes
Who lose? If you really ain't nobody 'til somebody love you
I say you ain't nobody 'til they speakin highly of you
And what I'm sure you wouldn't want is any kind of trouble
Unless you got a crash dummy or a body double
You got a couple homies down to catch a homi' for you?
Well I'ma fold niggaz into origami for you
The most notorious, poet laureate
Whole story is, glorious, stoic warriors
And, I got my eyes wide open on you quasi
Haters still smirkin like the Gators on the Izod
Lacoste, y'all tomato head niggaz are
imposters, long drawn-out process
Triple O.G.'s got a worn-out conscience
Reminiscin to when we was all-out monsters
on, our Sierra Leone, reignin tyranny
I strike fear in they hearts, rappers steer clear of me
Black, Sankofa, Ayatollah, Range Rover
Game's over, bill folder, give niggaz that Ebola virus
Huh? You got me chopped like Miley Cyrus
Nah, I'm on your block with Somali pirates

[Outro: Statik Selektah Scratchin]
For real man Statik man what's goodie?-"Raekwon"
Y-Y-Yeah y'all know I gets it on!-"Nas"
I-I-I ain't playin I'm truly the worst-"Big Pun"
A-A-Always goin about fast-"Joe Budden"
This is raw, raw like fuck kid represent-"Raekwon"
