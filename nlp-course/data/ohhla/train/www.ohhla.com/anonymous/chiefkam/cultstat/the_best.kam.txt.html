Artist: Chief Kamachi f/ Guru
Album:  Cult Status
Song:   The Best
Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Intro) Kamachi
Cult Status
Kamach
My man Guru, Baldhead Slick
Nah'mean, it's legendary

[Chief Kamachi]
Yo, Kamachi, Philly's my official strip
Past streets' scientific what I hit you with
The mind of an African initiate
I use my magic to murder any clique you get
Don't need to click a clip
I'm in the jungle where the Apollo stick
More powerful than any hollow tips
I'm out there like I blew up on the Apollo ship
I don't listen to Earth radio or follow hits
I'm a die for this hip-hop home I fought
And Guru got the temple of the bones that's bought
So I can create a world where my poems is taught
And now I got 'em caught
Like high-heals on the cracks of the boardwalk
Blood from their mouth when I give 'em the sword talk
Keep my eyes open like a war hawk
Their slugs melt, but I think they need more assault
When my black candles burning in the middle of white floor chalk
Kamach!

(Hook) Samples
"Mothafuckaz know who's the best"
"Kamachi"
"Call me Guru"
"Bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not, let me do my thang"

[Guru]
Bring it on, but make sure intentions are pure
Cuz like the saying goes - "All's fair in love and war"
Fuck they wanna try to dead a brotha for?
My bags are packed; I'm bout to head out for another tour
While back home, all the shorties learn to back chrome
They catch you slipping, you could get hit to the back of your dome
The New York blocks are still scorching, word up!
And it's the same down in Philly and the same up in Boston
Down South and out West, some don't move without vest
I feel a couple of rappers but I doubt the rest
Cuz I can tell they don't know what they in it for
They know their whole steez is weak
But won't even admit it at all
Don't wanna play the game by the rules
So again, the blind leads the blind
The fools is lead by the fools
And picture me not setting it straight
Uh, that's like a fat kid at a cookout not getting a plate
So bring it on

(Hook) Samples

[Guru]
Ayo I'm humble and calm but I still rumble and bum
Any fugase lazy rapper I crumble on my palm
They play rules, and they can never rock me
I'm well protected, well connected and I rock Kamachi
I'm about to Oz back from the culture stealers
Cuz we'll never see power unless we let our culture heal us
The strongest people, call us the soul survivors
So beware of the burning sands and the molten lava

[Chief Kamachi]
Yo the God known to control every cycle and season
This my Holy Land commercial ass disciples is leaving
When I hit 'em with this automatic rifle I'm breathing
And send their souls right back to the spiritual regions
My show gives listeners a miracle evening
Mary's womb is the spot that my voice was conceived in
Now understand me or what you should believe in
Don't care about my wrist as long as melanin is freezing

(Hook) Samples

(Outro) Guru
Word up, bring it on if you think you can hang
Stupid, yeah it's your man Guru
Gang Starr representing, AKA Baldhead Slick
Kno'm'sain, I'm in the house with my man Kamach
Straight like that, Philly to New York to Worldwide
Will put an end to your fronting behavior 
That's wazzup, shit's about to change, you heard
