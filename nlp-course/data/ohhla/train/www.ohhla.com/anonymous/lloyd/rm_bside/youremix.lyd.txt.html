[Andre 3000]
I said, "what time you get off?"
She said, "when you get me off"
I kinda laughed but it turned into a cough
Because I swallowed down the wrong pipe
Whatever that mean, you know old people say it so it sounds right
So I'm standing there embarassed, if we were both in Paris
I would have grabbed her by the waist and kissed her, but
We in the middle of whole foods, and those foods
Ain't supposed to beef, but you'd think I hated tofu
Check-in line got rowdy, my vision got cloudy
I started seeing some circles like some Audi
Emblem, I'm hearing them say, come on man
Do this own your own time, get the hell on, man
I walked out, hm, I got bout
Half-way to my car when I heard shorty shout
"3000, forgot your credit card, smart move
By the way, my little sister loves your cartoon"
Well, here's my name and numb
If I ain't the one, lose it, if I am, use it
If a man, chooses, and he can, do's it
And he don't, don't take it personal, he might be might be swamped
With making mozarella - no, making laws bettter
Cheese will come, believe me, I'm, never focussed on the cash
Ask Mel Gibson, Jesus Christ, I'm bout the pass... ion

[Lloyd]
Tired, baby bring that thang back
You know where my heart at
Shorty, would you press some love
Cause I'm about to lose it
With the way you move it
It's been making me do it
Girl tell me what it do
I'll change the game for you
I'm a player, yes it's true, but...

[Chorus]
Can I be for real?
This is how I feel
I'm in need of love
So let's dip up out of here
Oooh, you just my type
Everything so right
And I just wanna chill
So let's dip up out of here
Let's dip up out of here

[Bridge]
Ahh, ahh-ahh, ahhh-ahhhh...
She's fine too, but I want you...
Ahh, ahh-ahh, ahhh-ahhhh...
She's fine too, but I want you...

[Verse 2]
I'll admit it, this just ain't no game
These just ain't words that I'm spittin
If you could see that thugs that in my hair
I'm trippin, I'm a player, it's true
But I'll change the game for you
Wanna see what it do, oooh...

[Chorus]
Can I be for real?
This is how I feel
I'm in need of love
So let's dip up out of here
Oooh, you just my type
Everything so right
And I just wanna chill
So let's dip up out of here
Let's dip up out of here...

[Bridge]
Ahh, ahh, ahh-ahhh, ahhhh...
She's fine too, but I want you...
Ahh, ahh, ahh-ahhh, ahhhh...
She's fine too, but I want you...

[Nas]
Yeah, Nas be in the crib low, strip polin it
Cold guinness, bitter taste, slim waist, I'm gon hit it
We low-key baby, like a baritone
Apple com-puter, e-mail me to come scoop ya
Run through ya, undo ya bra, gimme medulla, uh
Ya cute as a movie star, in sin city, hennessey, my love slave
Lovin is pimpin, no rest 'have, with none of 'em
I would leave every one of em, you just say it
Just leave it where it is, he ain't aware of sleep and dogs lie
But keep a sharp eye on him, cause I'm the wrong guy
To wanna put this four-five on em, let's get it on, ma
You got my nose wide open
You already locked down and rot down, but so delicious
If he get suspicious, bring up his old mistress
I ain't dry-snitchin, but why should you be feelin bad
Cause I be killin that, huh?

[Chorus]
Can I be for real?
This is how I feel
I'm in need of love
So let's dip up out of here
Oooh, you just my type
Everything so right
And I just wanna chill
So let's dip up out of here
Let's dip up out of here...

[Bridge]
Ahh, ahh, ahh-ahhh, ahhhh...
She's fine too, but I want you...
Ahh, ahh, ahh-ahhh, ahhhh...
She's fine too, but I want you...</pre>
