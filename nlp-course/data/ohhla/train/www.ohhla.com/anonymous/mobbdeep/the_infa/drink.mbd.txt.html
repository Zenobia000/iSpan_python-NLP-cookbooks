Artist: Mobb Deep w/ Q-Tip
Album:  The Infamous
Song:   Drink Away the Pain (Situations)
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yeah, about to get my thug on
The 41st side of things

Verse One: Prodigy

I used to be in love with this bitch named E&J
Don't fuck with her anymore now I fuck with Tanqueray
Tanqueray introduced me to her first cousin Gold
Last name was Ide's and the first name Old
But Gold couldn't take the dick and made me lazy
We split apart and now I met this new trick Dany
Now me and Dany, we been together ever since
Our love combines to form a science, what is this
I bust a cherry, took her virginity in ninety-one
Now that she's open everybody want to tap somethin
Go get your own don't make me have to fuckin clap somethin
I love my shorty more than life now ain't that somethin
So love you Dany more than livin itself
Even though my friends tell me she ain't good for my health
When I go pick her up they tell me put her back on the shelf
They say say yo P she only wants you for one thing that's your wealth
But I don't pay attention, she's my baby, the Dany
You know she drive me crazy she's my number one lady
Met her back in eighty-nine now she's twenty-two
Actin like she forty, she said all I need is a man to support me
Besides, you from the 41st side of things
and Queensbridge niggaz be actin like they kings
Pushin Lexus' wearin fat diamond rings
My cellular phone reigns supreme, international think rational
The 12th street crew move back when we come through

Chorus:

I think the whole world's goin insane
I fill my brain up with Dany, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's goin insane
I fill my mind up with liquor, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's losin it's brain
I fill my brain up with liquor, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's goin insane
I fill my brain up with Dany, and drink away the pain

Verse Two: Q-Tip

Tommy Hil was my nigga, and other's couldn't figure
How me and Hilfiger used to move through with vigor
Had to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures
Said the Brinks is comin through, at Fashion Avenue
At Tuesday at two, now we gotta form a crew
Now we gotta forum a crew, of motherfuckers
who ain't goin out like suckers
Told me call Karl Kani, and all my other brothers
I told my sister Walker, who was the smoothest talker
Negotiate the deal with them other money stalkers
Diesel drove the the beemer, the hatchback of course
Nautica'll navigate to keep us on course
Polo's acting bolo trying to say he the Boss
I said shut the fuck up, the kid is out where the loot's at
Got a big trey pound, picture just to swoop back
Timb is on the roof with the twelve gauge rifle
Scope is on the top so you know he livin Eiffel
Took the aim of Oswald, caught him North in the face
All them other kids they had they tools aimed at space
Levi had the snub so you know they gettin laced
Donna Karan was cryin, cause mad shells was flyin
Damn all we want is a piece of the pie and
Nike scooped the sess cause he moves like Air
Threw them shits up in the trunk now we up out here
Got back to the mansion, to divvy up the paper
Helle Hansen was the brain of the whole entire caper
So she felt it was right, for her to get the whole slice
Everybody in the crew didn't think it was nice
I guess not, and guess what's hot, so guess what
Guess took the jigga, and jigged her in the gut

Chorus:

When you play with crime sometime's it's not too fly
Even though the goods look deceivin to the eye
The end situation could leave your ass dry
That's why you got to walk on by, walk on by
Walk on by, walk on by, walk on by...

Verse Three: Havoc

My man P put me on to the shorty Henn Rock
Now Henn Rock is strong enough to make your heartbeat stop
One sip I thought the bitch was a fuckin warlock
The more she started givin me the stronger I got
Pushed her off to the crew then she started gettin jealous
Steamed cuz I spent more CREAM with the fellaz
Fuck them niggaz spend that cheese on me
See if they be around when you need pussy
Then I thought to myself yo this drink is right
Gathered up all my dough, so I spent the night
I can't help it, she got my brain in a headlock
Niggaz started riffin why you trickin yo diz shit must stop
Moms like you need to see the AA
Better hope they help your ass out on the same day
But enough of that, I got the shake so I need dat
Son caught me stressed out I just be that
But when it comes to Hemp Rock dunn I need that
She's my shorty for life so fuck the weed bag

Chorus:

I think the whole world's goin insane
I fill my brain with the Henny, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's lost it's brain
I sip away on the liquor, and drink away the pain

Outro:

For the brothers who ain't here
Pour a little on the floor son
Time to get a little bent do our thing
Word up, the 41st side of Queens
We gettin bent, knowhatI'mean?
It's an everyday thing

Henny got my mind in a headlock
Dany got me goin crazy
Dany take me away
Dany take me away
Dany take me away
Word up
Dany take me away</pre>
