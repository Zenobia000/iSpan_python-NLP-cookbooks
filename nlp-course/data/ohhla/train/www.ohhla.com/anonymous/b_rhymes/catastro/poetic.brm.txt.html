Artist: Busta Rhymes f/ Q-Tip
Album:  Catastrophic (Mixtape)
Song:   Poetic Justice
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Look, tell me what you really wanna see
I had the greatest experience, you can have video, what's it gonna be?
I had to say it wowing, my heartbeat started pounding
Walked on the set while she got dressed and cocked wings on her outfit
Janet, why you doing this to me?
At the time I couldn't believe we both were starring in this movie
You in my video, you know a nigga loved it
I spent 2.4 million on the fucking budget
All my jewelry flooded, see how the kid was on?
First rap nigga album you've ever featured on
And I was weak in the Lord, despite the things we said
My first words to Hype Williams is "I can't believe this dream"
Shot a solo scene, I tried to make mines better
But I love when we shot together, and we rubbed up on each other
But I'm a little jealous, Tip, your tongue went in her mouth
In that Poetic Justice movie, from what I can account
You know what we be 'bout...
Any time, huh?
Any place, baby?

Now, you know, at the time, I was really
I really had my crush on shorty, man, you know what I mean?
Yeah, I was in love with shorty since she was Benny
and all that on Good Times and shit, you know what I mean?
Ayo, come one, you's a fucked up dude for doin' that to me, man
You broke my heart with that, man

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Come on, Buss, you know how many dudes say that to me? Like...
Once a day, girl, truly
We grew up with her through the lens of a camera
Didn't have much, but dare said I'm having her
Shorty was the joint, here's my case and point
Me and 'Pac rollin' L's in the trailer
Both of us get to scheming how to nail her
First movie about to come out in the theater
Pleasure principle, butt to the makeup truck, so ill I gave her my code
We kissed, I took her control, we swapped as all the film rolled
A marathon, we kept this good thing going, sunset, the moon, it came on
In my mind it would prolong
Listen, the scene was deaded, but I wanted my own edit
Me and Justice kissing keep it going, two pros with credit
A memorable summer in '92 out in Cali
When I got back up top my niggaz asked about the fatty
And did I smash her madly, to that I had to answer
Negative, but I'd give anything to be her dancer
A captivating lady, I used to be her baby
Good Times, they never fading
Look back and celebrate Poetic Justice

[Outro: Janet Jackson]
At any time, and any place, I don't care who's around
At any time, and any place, I don't care who's around
In the thunder and rain, you stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand moving up my thighs
In the thunder and rain, you stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand moving up my thighs</pre>
