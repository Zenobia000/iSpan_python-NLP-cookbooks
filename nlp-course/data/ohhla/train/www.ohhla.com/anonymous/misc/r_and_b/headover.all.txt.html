[NAS]
Yeah, The Firm
Track Masters, Escobar, Allure
Keep it raw
Hey yo, The Bridge, keep rockin'
We coming through, bottles poppin'
Allure, when your album droppin'
The place is packed
Many faces, there's some I know
And some know me from buying cases
Cash stack, shorties peepin'
Is she Puerto Rican, or half black
Puff, puff give, I need to live
Please pass that so I can zone
Maybe shoot a jewel in baby girl dome
It's a crazy world
Lemme drive you home, lets go
By the way, the name's ESCO
The platinum range make your man know he wet those
If he front I got the tech close 
To you much respect goes, the bond true
Had to put it on you
Allure you, you gotta leave 
I'll call you , it's been real

[Allure]
Boy I can't understand it
See I never really felt 
Like I do when I'm around you baby
And I just can't explain it
But I'm feeling so high
And I just can't deny
It's on you

Tell me you want my love
Baby please don't deny
What you're feeling inside
Say you've been thinking of 
Holding me, touching me, feeling my every need

1 - 	Head over heels
	It seems so real
	I feel like I'm falling in love
	I'm lost inside of my desire 
	Oh baby can't you see
	I'm falling for ya  head over heels

Baby, baby I'm longing
Just to have you to myself
I don't want nobody else, no
Baby my body's calling
Won't you come get my love
Because I really need you so much

Tell me you want my love
Baby please don't deny
What you're feeling inside
Say you've been thinking of
Holding me, touching me, feeling my every need

[NAS]
So much in common
I know you like the way I act
You been around real cats
All your life, since way back
You still got it
Cuz you was turned down once
Guess you learned
Ain't no future with them burnt out stunts
Left the hood to get your own thing
We're home team
Pushing through, watch ya chrome gleam
Yeah aiight, you probably heard that my pipe game's tight
Rocking VeVe S stones
Powder blue whips with egg headlights
The scent of weed gettin' all in your weave
I put out the trees
And crack the moon roof only for you to breathe
You get a extra set of keys
I tell the world while I'm out on tour
Keep your hands off my girls Allure

[Allure]
Baby, can't you see
How you make me feel
Oh, baby can't you see
I'm fallin' for you head over heels

Repeat 1 until fade</pre>
