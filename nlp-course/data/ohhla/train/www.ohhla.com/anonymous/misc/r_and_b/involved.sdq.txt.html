[Q-Tip]
Ummah, Ummah, Ummah

1 - 	S-A double-D-I-Q
	Yo, he wanna get involved with you
	Mr. S-A double-D-I-Q
	Yo, he wanna get involved with you
	Mr. S-A double-D-I-Q
	Yo, he wanna get involved with you
	Mr. S-A double-D-I-Q
	Yo he wanna get involved

[Raphael Saadiq]
Met this girl walking in the ghetto
(Uh huh, uh huh)
Looking good but looking down
(What's you say, come on by)
Said she needed inspiration
(What'd you say)
I said, 'Get yo shit cause we're goin uptown'
(Uptown baby, uptown, say what)
I could tell she was feelin better
(Yeah, yeah come on, yeah)
When she got inside the car
(When she got inside the car)
She was a dark-skinned girl with pretty cornrows
(uh uh)
She was doin her best to try to hide her scars
(Say come on now, what you say now)

	[Raphael Saadiq]
2 - 	I don't really care
	About that there, just get involved
	Boy you, makin me feel, uh oh so real
	Just get involved

[Raphael Saadiq]
Everytime i take you around friends
(Come on, everytime I take you around friends)
I catch them looking at you love
(Lookin' at you love, lookin' at you love like that)
You know it never ever bothered me
Because i know that i'm the one you're thinking of

Repeat 2

[Q-Tip]
Word up, word up, word up yo
Raphael just stopped in his tracks
Get involved and make it into the pack
You know the way that you present your thing
We in the belly so we might as well cling
The way you shine shorty you da shit
The princess in the pauper pit
We may be poor but we rich in soul
Just get involved and get in control
Just get involved and get in control
You know the way we do it, yo we roll

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Repeat 1</pre>
