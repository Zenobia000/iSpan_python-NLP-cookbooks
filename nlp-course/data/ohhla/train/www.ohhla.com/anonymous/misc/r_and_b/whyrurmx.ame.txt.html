Album:  Why R U? (Remix) 12"
Song:   Why R U? (Remix)
Typed by: Gemini_20502K@Yahoo.com, kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro: Amerie]
Why R U the one?

[Nas] (Sample courtesy of "One Love" by Whodini)
I need the mics to sound like 1987 on this
(From The L to the O! to the O! The V to the E to the E!!
Where the guys are strong and the girls are freeeeee!!!!!!)
(It's called looooooooovvvvvvveeeeeeeee city!!! city!!! city!!!) Yeah!

[Verse One: Nas] (Sample courtesy of "One Love" by Whodini)
(In CAPS are Amerie singing with Ectacy's vocals)

(The L! The L! The L!) Is it fair was it love, that took away Kazemi and McNair 
If it was, then I'm scared of love
(The O! The O! The O!) Uh! Money, sex, drugs your addiction
I know some niggas that succeded in love or prison
(And the V! And The V! And The V!) Like Vanessa love Kobe
That's the kind of love you got to show me you know me
(The E! The E! The E!) Through it all tell it all books and gossip
Marriage, divorce talk about the kid constant
(LOVE!!! LOVE!!! LOVE!!!) But it's never about (LOVE!!! LOVE!!! LOVE!!!)
But baby it's all (LOVE!!! LOVE!!! LOVE!!!)
Crazy....Amerie, get em'

[Verse Two: Amerie]
What's the reason, that I'm here again it's crazy
I keep waitin, but I'm foolish cause you'll never change
Wasted all my time and here I am still cryin over yooooouuuuuuuuu!!!!!!!
Over yooooouuuuuuuuu!!!!!!! Yeah!
(Lovin you is so hard!) I keep tryin baby
(I just end up with scars!) Cause I keep fightin baby
Lovin you it's like a battle that I can't afford to loooosseeeeeee!!!!
I can't loooosseeeeeee!!!! Is what I'm tellin you

[Chorus: Sample courtesy of "One Love" by Whodini] (Amerie)
One love, one love (You're lucky just to have just one looooovvvvveeeeeeee!!!)
One love, one love (But I'm wishin that you weren't the one!)
One love, one love (You're lucky just to have just one looooovvvvveeeeeeee!!!)
One love, one love (But I'm wishin that you weren't the one!)
(Ohhhhhhhh you weren't the one! That you weren't the one!
One love, one love (Hey!)

[Verse Three: Amerie]
And though I hate it, hate it that I can't forget you
I tried my best but, I'm a mess cause I can't shake you
Wanna call you but my pride won't let it get the best of meeeeeeeeeee!!!!
Best of meeeeeeeeeeeee!!! Yeah!!! Yeah yeah yeah!!!!

[Verse Four: Jadakiss]
EH-HAAAAAH!! Uh, yeah, yo...
Your best friend or your enemy it's all chemistry
Ain't even the outside, diggin the enemy
Even when I did somethin wrong you pretend to be (...nice)
Then you started sayin all these things that offended me (Right?)
I just let it ride though ma cause I been a G
You only live once though, and you 'gon remember me (mwah!)
I don't mind sayin I love her
Cause her mouth is sayin one thing, but her heart sayin another, what!

[Verse Five: Kain]
You gave me you love, was turned down again
You cried me a river, I learned how to swim (hehe)
When I wanted a touch, you wanted a friend
I died not to live with this sin
You used to say my blue eyes sang you a lullaby
The problem's that the pain made you colorblind (YEAH!)
Never mind that I'm drivin you 
Cashews can't cover the tears, so she cover the tattoos
I lost..

[Chorus: Sample courtesy of "One Love" by Whodini] (Amerie) (*Rick Ross)
One love, one love (You're lucky just to have just one looooovvvvveeeeeeee!!!)
One love, one love (But I'm wishin that you weren't the one!)
One love, one love (You're lucky just to have just one looooovvvvveeeeeeee!!!)
One love, one love (But I'm wishin that you weren't the one!)
(Ohhhhhhhh you weren't the one! That you weren't the one!
One love, one love (*Ricky Rossssssssss!!!)

[Verse Six: Rick Ross] (*Amerie) (Sample courtesy of "One Love" by Whodini)
(*Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, can't you see?)
Of course I'm bigger than the beef, tell the maid do my feet
Now my cut so crispy, shorty wanna frisk me
It's a newer model, but the top, that's history
My money is the mystery, your legs are officially mine
Got me throwin dollar signs up in Tiffany's
Next to the stones, she's the only thing flawless
Yes - one love baby, you deserve all this
(The L! The L! The L!) for the Lexus that we always push
(The O! The O! The O!) Six hundred for that onion a kush
(And the V! And The V! And The V!) That mean we livin on the verge
(The E! The E! The E!) Everyday, I hear the words
BOSS!!!

[Chorus: Sample courtesy of "One Love" by Whodini] (Amerie) (*Rick Ross)
One love, one love (Your lucky just to have just one looooovvvvveeeeeeee!!!)
One love, one love (But I'm wishin that you weren't the one!)
One love, one love (Your lucky just to have just one looooovvvvveeeeeeee!!!)
One love, one love (But I'm wishin that you weren't the one!)
(*But I am the one baby!!! We can never change that! It is what it is!)
One love, one love, your lucky just to have just one looooovvvvveeeeeeee!!!
One love, one love, your lucky just to have just one looooovvvvveeeeeeee!!!
(*When you fall in love it's just, catchin lightning in a bottle, it's that special moment)
One love, one love, your lucky just to have just one (*You can never deny me baby!)
One love, one love, your lucky just to have just one looooovvvvveeeeeeee!!! 
(*You will never deny me baby! One! Ross!)</pre>
