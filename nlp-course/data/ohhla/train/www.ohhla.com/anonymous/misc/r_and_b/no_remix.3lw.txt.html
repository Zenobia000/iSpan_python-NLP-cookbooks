[Nas]
Everyday she walk by
See me on the same block
Same crew, like she never seen rocks
Chain watch, rims blue
Different color boots on, park Yukon
You predicates ex-cons, rip arms, bettin' chips
Puff medicine play my gangsta beats
Tunnel bangers, Flex, Clue tapes bang in the streets
I'm just a fly, thuggish baller shorty anxious to meet
Till I die keep wanting to head mink to the feet
But shorty jail bait, might get me five to life
Maybe in time you can be Nas's wife
Place school, study law
I'mma pay your tuition
Come on campus, buy you books
Do your babysitting
My unusual style make your future unwild
When you get older I'mma bless you with a child
See now you was unaware that this thug had affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection

1 - [3LW]
    It's either you will
    Either you won't
    Sometimes you do
    Sometimes you don't
    Sometimes it's yes
    Other times it's no
    But I can't take it no more
    Take your wrong and make it right
    Just say you can make up your mind
    Is it serious or isn't it?
    Cause I can't take it no more

Make 'em clap to this...

Baby, baby you keep
Putting things before me
But I was there for you when you had nothing
So baby, baby
Basically it's them or me
Now or never
Give me all or nothing

Repeat 1

Make 'em clap to this...

Baby, baby
You keep telling me you're changing
You promise you will be a better man
But no soon as you see your peeps
There you go switching out on me
And we're back at square one again

[Nas]
Don 3, can't get with me
Y'all just a child-child
Maybe I can get you with little Sammie and Bow Wow
Please girls try to understand me now-now
Like my little sisters I'mma hold you down-down
Got the whole world in your hands
Three little woman got these young boys tryna be their man
Do your thing shorty but if they get disrespectful
Get on your cell phone call big brother Esco
Now let's go

[3LW]
Cause all this back and forth
In and out, ups and downs
Is beginning to wear me out
See you gotta tell me now
Tell me now
Don't wait till the end
It's either me or your friends
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Trackmasters]
Remix, Trackmasters, Remix
Remix, Precision, Remix
We about to make ya clap to this
Remix, uh

Repeat 1 till end</pre>
