[Nas talking]
It must be nice ... damn right it's nice
Wish you could get in my shoes, baby
It's crazy, man
A thug love letter for you foes
A thug love letter..

[Nas]
A thug love letter written in mimosas for ink
Pen wobbles on paper, Hypnotiq, I'm chaser
I spit the escape for prisoners of paper
Couples in trouble, good people with bad nature
Temptations, me and the queen, a better team
Than Kareem and Worthy, in that new SL early
Me and Ms. Purty, happy, live through me
Vicariously, I made it safe for gangstas to marry
Life..

[Lyfe]
Must be nice
Having someone who understands the life you live
Must be nice
Having someone who's slow to take and quick to give
Must be nice
Having someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick
someone who's smile is bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion
Must be nice
Having someone who loves you despite your faults
Must be nice
Having someone who talks the talk but also walks the walk
Must be nice
Having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too
someone who loves you for sho'
you just remember to never let 'em go

[Chorus: Lyfe]
Even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side still holding on
Even when those 20's stop spinning
and all those gold-digging women disappear
she'll still be here

[Lyfe]
Must be nice
Having someone you can come home to from a long day of work
Must be nice
Having someone you don't have to show they know exactly where it hurts
Must be nice
Having someone who trusts you despite what they've heard
Someone as mighty as a lion but still as gentle as a bluebird
Must be nice
Having someone you don't have to tell you don't want to be alone
Must be nice
Having someone you can grow old with until God calls ya'll home
Must be nice
Having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too
someone who loves you for sho'
you never let 'em go

[Chorus]

[Nas]
My man just came home, talking that "I'ma get rich" stuff
He ain't stitched up, being he was sent up
Inside a maximum prison, he laughing and grinning
On the streets again, relaxing with women
Asked if I've been in--the Oscar awards
Have I driven the most popular cars
Sitting in Maybachs with stars
What's happening, Nas
I say I stay grounded
My paper, don't count it
Just notice I'm glowing
Just watch and keep growing

[Chorus]</pre>
