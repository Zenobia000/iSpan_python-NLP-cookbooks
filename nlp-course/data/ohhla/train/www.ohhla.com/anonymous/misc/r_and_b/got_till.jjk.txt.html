[Janet]
Have a feeling, now believing; that you

Oh how I'm wishing; thinking dreaming
bout you, and the love
How'd I ever let you get away

[Joni Mitchell]

[Q-Tip] What?  Joni Mitchell never lies

*DJ scratch* that you don't know what you've got til it's gone

[Janet]If I could turn back (yeah) the hands of time (mmm-hmm)
Make you, fall in love, in love with me again
So would you give me, another chance, to love
To love you, love you the right way, no games
[Joni Mitchell]

*DJ scratch*

[Q-Tip]
One two, one two, yo
Let me just fuck with it for a minute... what?
(*DJ scratch* that you don't know what you've got til it's gone)
Now you realizin when them nights go long, right
Campaign for me to stay when you know that I'm gone, right
You act all wild, when I tell you to settle
I was workin round the clock, but your girls want to meddle
("I heard!  Knahmsayin?  I heard that you was on the beach...")
Talk about I heard he swims with this chick on the beach
That was out with the tide, but my love you impeach
Now you lookin at the walls, head in hands, cold jonezin
Ringin my house, hangin up and then posin
Now why you wanna go and do dat love, huh?
Now why you wanna go and do dat and do dat huh?(repeat 4X)

[Joni Mitchell]
*DJ scratch* Don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you've got til it's...
(repeat 3X)

[Q-Tip] Joni Mitchell never lies

*DJ scratch* That you don't know what you've got til it's gone

[Q-Tip]
Uh-uhh uhh, uh-uh, uh-uh uhh
Uh-uhh uhhh uhh uhh, uh uh
Yo yo, do you feel that, uhh uhh?

*Janet laughing with Q-Tip*

T-t-t-t-that you don't know what you've got til it's gone
