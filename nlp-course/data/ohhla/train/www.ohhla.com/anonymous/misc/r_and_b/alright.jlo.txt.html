Artist: Jennifer Lopez f/ Nas
Album:  I'm Gonna Be Alright CDS
Song:   I'm Gonna Be Alright (Remix)
Typed by: compbuttons@hotmail.com

[Jennifer Lopez & (Nas)]
Oh yes (Uh, this for you girl)

[Nas]
Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like Ginger from "Casino" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cards in yo hand
All I know, when Nas was yo man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'

[Jennifer Lopez]
Money, cars for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me "This ain't right"
Don't you know, it's not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
Cause I love you I just got to say

[Chorus]
I used to say I didn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it 
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
I said I didn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it 
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)

[Jennifer Lopez]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Cause I expect so much from you
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize, I can't change you

[Chorus]

[Jennifer Lopez & {Nas}]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do (Need to do)
To be OK (I need to be OK)
I never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Be leaving without you (Leaving without you) {Huh, this life is crazy}
So now it's time for me to make that move

[Nas with J.Lo ad-libs]
Huh check it
Yo nobody understands me, I'm dealin' with pressure
My peoples is locked in a jail cell with no bail stressin'
Guess it's the life of a kingpin
Rap Stephen King, rap bling
like neon lights, we gon' be alright
But it's like, you feelin' me lesser
Claim I'm actin' like a retard, right?
Me and my boys, we start fights, when will I mature
You scream I'm in the streets all night
Or where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat
I'm slow caught

[Chorus]</pre>
