Typed by: Ghettofabulous98@hotmail.com

[Nas](Mariah & Joe)
Cluemanati
MC to the J-O-E
(Make it last)
Nastradamus remix
(Make it last forever)
For the world
Make it real, baby
Uh, Desert Storm, baby
Uh, check it
(Thank God I found you)
This for you

[Nas](Mariah & Joe)
Let's show the world you're my golden girl
When we shoppin' they see us on the streets
They say 'Son, scooped a hot one'
You taste like banana cake
You shaped like the number eight
And you my number one candidate
I can't lose you, it's like I'm bettin' in Vegas, crucial
Sweatin', knowin' these players is wantin' you, Boo
I get the chills when you in my sight
Feels like it's meant to be right
(Thank God I found you)
I feel a rush when I kiss you at night, uh

[Joe]
Shorty knows she my baby girl and
Player haters try hard to get her
But she'll be lounging in my cradle tonight, oh
Typically a thug wouldn't say this
But you see your love has got me faded
No girl ever made me feel like you do, oh

[Mariah]
Hmm I'mma be here night after night to
Feel your loving arms around me
Baby, baby, baby, baby, you make it all right
No one but you baby, can make me feel
The way you make me, make me, make me feel, oh

[Mariah & Joe](Nas)
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last)
Make it last
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last)
Don't our let our love end
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last)
Oh, don't you let it end
Make it last forever and ever
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last)
Thank God I found you

[Joe & Mariah]
Your touch is wonderful (So wonderful)
Your love is so marvelous
Joy, that's what I feel
When I'm with you, yeah (Yeah)
Nothing, no one (No one, boy)
Could compare to what we have (Oh no, baby)
Love, it feels so good
I'm so glad you're mine, oh

[Mariah & Joe](Nas)
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Make it last forever
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't let our love end (No, no, no, no, no, no)
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last)
Make it last forever and ever
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last)
Thank God I found you

[Nas](Mariah)
What? A thug's dream wife, jeans tight, beautiful skin
Matching brown Timbs, hot as jalapenos
She knows how to hide the ninos
The rap Rudolph Valentino
In beef I become the black Al Pacino
Relax, sweetie, in Benz you could watch the TV
Or lay back and pump Mariah's hot CD
And I'mma touch you in the wrong places
Or we could walk through the park
In our bubble north faces, I'm lost in your love
Thank God I found you, you my crown jewel
I'm sayin' boo the type I give my last name to
(Make it last)
At Lover's Lane put the top up
When it start to rain in the parkin' lot
Then we finish doing our thing
Fog the windows gettin' very sentimental
Sippin' Cosmos with the cherry in the middle
I keep it honest, word to Will that's my promise
Signin' off, truly yours, Nastradamus

[Mariah & Joe](Nas)
Thank God I found you, thank you, Lord
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last)
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, don't you let it end
Make it last, oh baby
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last)
See I was so lost without your love
I was lost without you
(Make it last, make it last)
My every wish and dreams became reality
Thank God I found you
(Make it last, make it last)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last, make it last)
(2000)
Make it last
(Nastradamus)
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
(Mariah, uh, uh Cluemanati, uh to the J-O-E
My baby I'm so thankful
(Thank God for you baby, that's right)
Thank God I found you
(Make it last, make it last)
Thank God I found you
(Make it last, make it last)
I was so lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last, make it last)
My sunshine, my whole life
Make it last forever, baby
(Make it last, make it last)
Thank God I found you</pre>
