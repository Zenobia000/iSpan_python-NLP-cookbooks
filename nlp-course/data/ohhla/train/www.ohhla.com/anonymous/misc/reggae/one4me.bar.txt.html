[Chorus: Barrington Levy & Guru]
I don't wanna (2x)(Come on)
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna (2x)
I don't wanna (2x)
I don't wanna lose you
Ohho she's the one for me
Fly sexy girl she's the one for me
Ohho she's the one for me
My pure ghetto princess
Ohho she's the one for me
Didn't (didn't I) I blow your mind, that's right
Didn't (didn't I) make you shine, true
Didn't (didn't I) make you mine, that's right

[Barrington Levy & Guru]
Cause I don't wanna (2x)
I don't wanna lose you

I don't wanna lose you
Ohho she's the one for me
Ghetto princess she's the one for me
Ohho she's the one for me
The lover of my life she's the one for me

[Verse 1: Guru]
I took her out the club just to show her love
She said; there's no-one above
And right after we rubadub
All alone at her rest
She placed my head to her chest
She said I was the best, God bless
I like the way she's on-point
Turnin' heads every time when she steps in the joint

[Barrington Levy & Guru]
Ohho she's the one for me, that's the girl for me
Ohho she's the girl for me, sexy girl she's the girl for me
Ohho she's the one for me
Fly sexy mama she's the one for me

[Barrington Levy & Guru & Jigsy King]
I don't wanna (2x)
I don't wanna lose her
I don't wanna (2x)
I don't wanna (2x)
I don't wanna lose her
Ohho she's the one (girl) for me
Pure ghetto princess she's the one (girl) for me
The sexy mama she's the one for me
Didn't I blow your mind, THIS TIME
Didn't I make you mine, THIS TIME
Didn't I make you shine
Didn't I oh oh oh ohho

(Verse 3: Jigsy King singing/rapping)

[Barrington Levy & Jigsy King]

Ohho she's the one for me, shock
Ohho she's the one for me, I'm not widdit
Ohho she's the one for me, shock

[Barrington Levy & Guru]
Didn't (didn't I) I blow your mind, that's right
Didn't (didn't I) make you shine, true
Didn't (didn't I) blow your mind, aha
Cause I don't wanna (2x)
I don't wanna lose her
I don't wanna (2x)
I don't wanna (2x)
I don't wanna lose her
I don't wanna (2x)
Ohho she's the one (girl) for me
Ohho she's the girl for me, fly sexy girl she's the one for me
Ohho she's (yeah she's) the one for me
Ohho (I like the way you do) she's the one for me
Ohho she's the one for me

Yeah, her body, word to mother, she's thin
Shinin' like a gem, attractive to all men
Confidence and pure in points I give her all ten
