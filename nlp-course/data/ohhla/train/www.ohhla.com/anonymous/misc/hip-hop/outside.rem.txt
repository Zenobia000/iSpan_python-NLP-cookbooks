[Verse 1: Michael Stipe]
You took me to the restaurant where we first met
You knocked a future shock crowbar upside my head
I got caught with the stop of the tick-tock, tick-tock clock
When you told me what you knew..

Lost in the moment, the day that the music stopped
and I do remember you

[Chorus]
Drawing patterns with a cork on the tablecloth
Promising volcanic change of plot
Where will this lead us? I'm scared of the storm
The outsiders are gathering and a new day is born

[Verse 2: Michael Stipe]
I tried to tell you I am not afraid
You looked up and saw it all across my face
So am I with you or am I against?
I don't think it's that easy, we're lost in regret

Now I'm trying to remember
The feeling when the music stopped
When you told me what you knew
Lost in the moment, the day that the music stopped
and I do remember you

[Chorus 2: 2X]
Drawing patterns with a cork on the tablecloth
Promising volcanic change of plot
Where does this leave us? I'm scared of the storm
The outsiders are gathering and a new day is born

The outsiders are gathering and a new day is born
The outsiders are gathering...

[Q-Tip]
A man walks away when every muscle says to stay
How many yesterdays? They each weigh heavy
Who says what changes may come?
Who says what we call home?
I know you see right through me, my luminescence fades
The dusk provides an antidote, I am not afraid
I've been a million times in my mind
This is really just a technicality, frailty, reality
Uh, it's time to breathe, time to believe
Let it go and run towards the sea
They don't teach that, they don't know what you mean
They don't understand, they don't know what you mean
They don't get it, I wanna scream
I wanna breathe again, I wanna dream
I wanna float a quote from Martin Luther King
I am not afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid
..
I am not afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid
