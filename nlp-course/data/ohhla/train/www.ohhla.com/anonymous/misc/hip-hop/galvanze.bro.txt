(Don't hold back)
'Cause you woke up in the morning with initiative to move
so why make it harder

(Don't hold back)
If you think about it so many people do, be cool man
look smarter

(Don't hold back)
And you shouldn't even care, about the losers in the air
and their crooked stares

(Don't hold back)
'Cause there's a party over here, so you might aswell be here
where the people care

(Don't Hold Back)

World..
(You're holdin back)
the time has come to..

World..
(You're holdin back)
the time has come to..

World..
(You're holdin back)
the time has come to..

Galvanize

C'mon with that
C'mon with it

(Ad-libs)

(Don't hold back)
If you think about it too much you may stumble, trip up
fall on your face

(Don't hold back)
You think its time you get up, crunch time like a sit-up
pull monkey face

(Don't hold back)
Put apprehension on the back burner
let it sit, don't even get it lit

(Don't hold back)
Get involved with the jam, don't be a prick
hot chick be your fave

(Don't hold back)

World..
(You're holdin back)
the time has come to..

World..
(You're holdin back)
the time has come to..

World..
(You're holdin back)
the time has come to..

Galvanize

C'mon with that
C'mon with it

(Ad-libs)

World, the time has come to
(Push the button)

World, the time has come to
(Push the button)

World, the time has come to
(Push the button)

World
My finger is on the button
My finger is on the button
My finger is on the button
(Push the button)

The time has come to..

GALVANIZE!
