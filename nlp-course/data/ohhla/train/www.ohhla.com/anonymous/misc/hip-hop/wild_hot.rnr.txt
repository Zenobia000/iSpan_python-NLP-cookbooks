Song:   Wild Hot

Q-Tip:I got the Busta bust 
      Yo, we make the shit wild hot 
Busta:We got Kamaal
      Complete, we make the shit wild hot
Q-Tip:I got the Busta bust
      Yo, we make the shit wild hot
Both:All y'all rude boys lick a shot  (gun shot)

Q-Tip:I be the all-I-seein'
      The MCin'     
      Human bein'    
      Soon to be in your museum
      When I'm in your colisseum
      I'm MCin'
      Punishin' wack niggas for disagreein'
      Did you see him?
      No, 'cause he move like the wind, in flight   
      Counter-attack like a Jedi Knight
      If you're goin' to think about combatin'  
      General Latin
      Of this MC shit you did, killa
      You just a private in the lower class    
      I be the upper at your lawn    
      Don Juan, when the mic's on     
      Chief Abstract, Ace Quasimoto
      Fuckin' with me, you'll be finished like photo   
      I'm sure to bust your shit like bolo    
      Black Nation needs a team, fuck solo    
      I can see ya in your eyes the webness   
      When your ass starts to cry it's redness
      You can witness the style that I kick from the linguistics   
      But please come, so save it
      Dealin' with the try, but you never can    
      My nigga Busta Rhymes about to get his man
      Ay yo, we do it like this and then we do it like that    
      It's the Abstract with the new format      
      We do it like this and then we do it like that    
      It's the Busta bust with the new format

Busta:FIGARO, Figaro, Figaro
      Bust yo shit, scar yo windpipes and make me break yo elbow   
      Put my foot in your ass slow
      Feel the force like a race horse or like a heard of buffalo    
      Teel me why you be actin' soft     
      Freak the Spanish flow
      Like Julio ?Lepingpacndahoe?
      Freeze like chilly Willy the Eskimo     
      Vigilante like Steven Segal      
      Now bust the desperado
      You fuckin' with the all time pros
      While the zoom lens ammorate niggas from transistor radios   
      Mission Impossible without expose 
      Once I diagnose those who be creepin' blow 'em off they tippy toes    
      Sorry, fake nigga that's how it goes     
      Sport the suede-front bullet proof vests in case 
      you complicate my dough  
      Handle situations pronto
      While appearances got you all hearin' this when I be doin' cameos     
      Shit be Wild Hot like Tabasco
      Fuck the fool-ass nigga trespass and caught him in my last zone      
      Stick a nigga bad like the last hole     
      Runnin' up on muthafuckas late night jumpin' out the astro     
      No, No,No,No,No
      If you violate I start to dictate just like Fidel Castro      
      Make you dreadlock yo' afro    
      And when I'm done I ride of with theme music by my man D'Angelo     
      We make the shit Wild Hot
        
      Chorus (x3)
