"Super fat" "Out of Control"
"Treat the girl like a punk" "It gets done"
"Make your blood stop flowing"

"It gets done"
"Should I do it"

What a supriser
Open your eyes up
Woman advisor

[Verse One: Slick Rick]
The name of this entertainment is 'Women Lose Weight'
Our first years of marriage, everything was just great
But after two kids and the weight gain factors
Fact is, now she's completely unattractive
Look fat chicks, I don't mean to sound rude
I tell them nice, hit the gym and don't eat so much food
But noooo, "You're shallow, you need to run the course of
unconditional love and so forth"
But how, if desire's not there, that's just delayment
Divorces, child support, alimony payments
My own happiness I doubt discouraged
So hurry for an easier way out this marriage
Meanwhile my secretary June, well-groomed
"When you gonna leave your wife?"
I tell her, "Soon mami soon, I assume"
but my destiny is blue
Interestingly the only thing left for me to do is to kill her

"It gets done" "Treat the girl like a punk" 
I'm gonna have to kill her "Tell the truth" "Take the life of anybody"
(Send that ass right to the morgue miss) Kill her "It gets done" 
"Make your blood stop flowing"
I'm gonna have to kill her "Out of control"
(Send that ass right to the morgue miss)

[Verse Two: Slick Rick]
My plan against or shenanigans kinda ran thin
Knowing nothing 'bout poisening and I can't swim
Bad intentions pumping, might as well become numb
Cut her lungs or the obvious robbery gone wrong
But the catch is, do I have the nerve to dispatch this
Who could I get to help me murder this fat chick
Guess I'll have to play a dude robbin' on Wednesday
the day she usually goes food shopping
Anyway, long story short, hit the side of her Chrysler
Sent it clean over the divider
"You bastard!" she said as the wreck, went tumbling down the hill
I thought she has to be dead
Later on, get a call from the lieutenant O'Rourke
Had me leapin' like a frog, "We need you at the morgue"
So I selfishly persue, boo hoo there was nothing else for me to do
I had to kill her

"It gets done" "Treat the girl like a punk" 
Come on y'all, you know I had to kill her "Tell the truth" "Take the life of anybody"
(Send that ass right to the morgue miss) Killed her "It gets done" 
"Make your blood stop flowing"
I had to kill her  "Out of control"
(Send that ass right to the morgue miss)

[Rick:    ] So you mean to tell me officer you have no clue who did this
"Tell the truth"
[Officer: ] No sir, we don't have no clue right now
[Rick:    ] This is terrible, what am I gonna tell the kids
[Officer: ] Pull yourself together sir
[Rick:    ] I'm just so broken up inside I can't believe this
[Officer: ] I understand, I understand
"Tell the truth"
[Rick:    ] Catch the person who did this
[Officer: ] We're gonna try sir
[Rick:    ] Please 
"Take the life of anyb..."

[Verse Three: Slick Rick]
Screaming who done took my heart
Acting shooken up a lot, at the funeral
Though everyone was lookin' at me hard, like I did it
Like I was the reason my mate slain
Murmering "I heard he was displeased with her weight gain"
While my secretary, sort of a sexy blonde, can't cook
All she does is order from restaurants
All of the sex he wants, I doubt could address
clothes not washed proper and house look a mess
And talkin' to detectives who were waiting outside
How I took a long lunch break, day the wife died
I darn near turned pale and because of betrayal
They indicted me, gave me an impossible bail
Good fortune to anybody admiring the rawtent
Moral of the story is, desire is important
So watch your weight, it will keep your mate smitten, it's a given
Though looking back I realise I didn't have to kill her

"It gets done" "Treat the girl like a punk" 
I didn't have to kill her "Tell the truth" "Take the life of anybody"
(Send that ass right to the morgue miss) Killed her "It gets done" 
"Make your blood stop flowing"
I didn't have to kill her "Out of control"
(Send that ass right to the morgue miss)
