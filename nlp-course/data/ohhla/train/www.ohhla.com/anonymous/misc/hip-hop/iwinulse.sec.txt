[Intro]
Yeah you gon' lose man, that's right
I don't even know why you tryin' to do this to yourself
It's a rapping crown straight up

[Hook]
U gonna lose, so why go against the brother
I'm gonna win, i'm much more prepared than you
U gonna lose, in cali you're the ultimate buster
I'm gonna win, in new york I fear for you

I got game spillin' out my brain and things
With my funky ass style, I remain the king
Now coochie shot derek for a diamond ring
While slim took his wife for an island fling
I design to swing, take you under my wing
I got ya little rappers, you're my underlings
I know you're wondering how I do this to ya
Descendant double R, some tribe i'm like luger
The ebony scent lines like paint remover
Uncoverin' the truth, livin' proof I fool ya
And just like some they thought they held the title
I come through like Martin when he held the bible
In addition got necessary means like Malcolm
Don't wanna see ya sell no more workin acts
Messin with one of the best then I suggest you pop off
And get it off your chest

[Hook 2x]

From cali to new york, it's the social norm
Fly niggas like myself make the haters swarm
Whether rocking my adidas or with gators on
I let y'all know right now and fuck later on
I'm the man, baldhead slick in the clip
Y'all tired ass rappers, I know you're sick of this shit
I got your shorty all up on the dick of this shit
Step up you fucking clown, I get ridiculous quick

[Hook 2x]

Don't even try it punk
You got no wins here, you got no friends here
Hot ones fear, I know you're bitch scared

I'm prepared to face the pressure when I put it on ya
I'm the lady controller, body temperature changer
The rich casanova, girl release that anger
Now when I say bitch, well i'm rich in lyrics
And that turns to cash and still i'm rich in spirit
Takin' off my jacket, my darkest classic
I'm bound to elevate to kingpin in this racket
A lot of punks got fat while I was playing the low
A lot of punks is ho's, know what i'm saying yo

[Hook 2x]

So why go against the brother
I'm much more prepared than you
In cali you're the ultimate buster
In new york I fear for you
U gonna lose
I'm gonna win
U gonna lose
I'm gonna win

[Outro]
I told you man
Got yourself all caught up in the motherfuckin' spot
With me you know the outcome stupid, jeah
It's your man baldhead slick
Lettin' all these lil flippy ass, take a bow rappers know what's really poppin off
Straight like def
Up against me, you gonna lose
The B-A-L-D head to the slick, you know me uh
Peace to my man Ced
Aiyyo Ced, we squeak e. clean on this one uh
Yeah y'all, you know you gonna lose, beeatch
