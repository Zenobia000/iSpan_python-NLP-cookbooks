Yeah, DJ Premier on the remix
It's Big Guru with Tin Tin Out
GangStarr forever baby
Hehe, I am what I am
You know wha I'm sayin'
Hehe, check it
Hey-yo Emma, sing something for the people here...

[Emma Bunton]
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean

Philosophy
Is the talk on a cereal box
Religion
Is the smile on a dog
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean
D-do ya?

Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

What I am is what I am
You what you are are what
What I am is what I am
You what you are are what
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean
D-do ya?

Philosophy
Is a walk on the slippery rocks
Religion
Is the light in the fog
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean
D-do ya?

Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep
Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

What I am is what I am
You what you are are what
What I am is what I am
Are what you are are what
What I am is what I am
You what you are are what you are
What I am is what I am
And what you are is what you
Na na na no
I say, I say, I say, I do, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Guru]
When I talk its like Amazing Grace
You save the face
With this Primo and Guru remix
You're staying laced
She's very aware, I'm very sincere
No I'm not a chauvinist
Just very debonair
Lets make haste
I got no time to wait
You never met a real brotha who could rhyme this great
Pure intensity, that's what I got here
You know I am what I am so I'm blowing up the spot here

[Emma Bunton]
What I am is what I am
You what you are are what
What I am is what I am
Are what you are are what
What I am is what I am
You what you are what you are
What I am is what I am
Are what you are is what you..
