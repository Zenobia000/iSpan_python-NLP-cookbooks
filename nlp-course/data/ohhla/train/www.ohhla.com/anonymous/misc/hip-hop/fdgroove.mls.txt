(Evolution Of the Groove)
Yeah, yeah, (Evolution), yeah, yeah
Turn me up louder and louder
Evolution of the Groove; like ape to man, man to alien
Like drinking wells to Evian
From Shakespeare to Makavelian
Not much change same game just different names
Evolution like how we shot dice
Got nice with a small SONY box on the blocks every night
Evolution like Herbie Hancock on piano
Ron Carter on que sticks
All live music's not a sample
Tony Williams on drum sticks
Olu Dara plays the trumpet; Miles Davis conducts this
The Evolution of the Groove
A room full of gods and goddess, a table, some chairs
A glass of the best bottle that aged for years
The fashion express; immaculate wears
The stages lit up, he comes on backwards, we stare
(What's your name?) With his back to us
Jazz music, fingers snap to it
Fast forward; 2007; Nas'll rap to it
So proud to be alive to tell you young chaps who is
The artist 'cause I rap think I'm that clueless?
See my hat tilted, foul move, loud, rude
Think I ain't that dude who value the art that Miles do
Like I don't get down to the Miles tunes
What ya think I lounge to? Bjork, Marvin
Prince, I crave Lennon and they all got a 'lil Miles Davis in 'em
