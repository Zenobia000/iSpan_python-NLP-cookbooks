[George Clinton]
Oooww! I lay me down to sleep!
Said ohhh I just can't find the beat!
Everybody say flashlight!
Aaaahhhh yeah!
Flashlight!
Everybody's got a little light!
Flashlight!
Everybody say flashlight!

[Vocal breakdown]

There's no use, oh won't you tell her go with me!
Say flashlight! Red light! Yeah!
Most of all need to find the funk
Said help me find the funk
Most of all, need to find it
Help them find it

Aaahhhh! Hey hey!!!
Everybody's got a little light!
Under the sun!
I gotta help em
Help em find the funk
Most off all, help em

Aahhhhhh!
Mooove your sexy body
Shine your flashlight
Get your rump out on the floor
Mooove your sexy body
Shine your flashlight
Get your rump out on the floor

[Q-Tip]
You got to shine the light because things ain't right
Funk signs up, makes for a good night
Kid let me tell you bout your fate
As the mothership connects in CC, Chocolate City
Got kids under pressure with the Bop Gun boppin
We non-stoppin, the whole joint cold rockin
Everybody up, we put it down for uncle jam
An allstar client plus the number one fan
Hold the Parliment funk so come and bump your rump
It's all for a good cause, eliminatin applause

[Busta Rhymes]
Eliminatin applause, eliminatin applause
Yo, come on baby let me suck your soul
And lick your funky emotion you know we on a roll
All glow as my people full of sorrow, tomorrow
You free your mind, your ass'll follow
Busta Rhymes come on complete, representin
Stay shittin on funk beats with George Clinton
Before we flip you really need to take a trip
On the fully equipped all expenses paid mothership

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
This recordin is dirty and stinkin
Funky is the type of ?lepew? I'm thinkin
About, droppin this single on the charts
Lettin you know that the kid has heart
I never denied myself as bein dope
When a nigga slept on my jam
Nigga caught the notes
Hey sugar plum, hi, can you assume
Bitch that the volume never has tune
I'm not your everyday regular rap star
(....?....)
Beware of the hardware, please the hard way

[P-Funk]
(....?....) mayday
Not H-O-G day, payday
Palladium day
Stagin the L-I-G-H-T day
And can you feel it? Boo yah!
Oh you're fryin
Like he done take two hits a niacin
Kinda like a chemical (..?..)
Hot damn, holy smokes, what up
So we havin a huge discussion
And pretty soon, spontaneous combustion
We on the map, well you can just sit around
Or funk burn, you got to burn
Di du joogedy di di dince dice
Dum dum, dingbat damn, I say man
Let's try it again, show your friend
Is it true (.?.) naw, is it two eyes and hips?
Well how the hell we gon get out this shit?
And then the shit get lit

[Repeat these phrases till fade]
Most of all, help them find the funk
Help them find the funk
Help them find the funk, the funk, the funk
Everybody's got a little
Everybody's got a little light
Everybody's got a little light
Help them find the funk!
Flashlight! Flashlight!
Everybody's got a little
Flashlight!
